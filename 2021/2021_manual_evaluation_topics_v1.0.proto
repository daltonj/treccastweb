Lobular carcinoma: This starts in the lobules. Invasive breast cancer is when the cancer cells break out from inside the lobules or ducts and invade nearby tissue, increasing the chance of spreading to other parts of the body. Non-invasive breast cancer is when the cancer is still inside its place of origin and has not broken out.h"Ñ/Once it breaks out, how likely is it to spread?"7Once the cancer breaks out, how likely is it to spread?2LOnce it breaks out, how likely is lobular carcinoma breast cancer to spread?BMARCO_D684514b∂Even though this condition doesn‚Äôt spread, it‚Äôs important to keep an eye on it.

This cancer accounts for about 10% of all invasive breast cancer cases. Prognosis for infiltrating and invasive lobular breast carcinomas will naturally be influenced by tumor size, grade, stage and hormone receptor status.. However, lobular breast cancers, when positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors, tend to respond very well to hormone therapy. The overall breast cancer survival rates for infiltrating lobular carcinoma, when matched by stage, are a little higher than for ductal carcinoma for the first 5 years. Survival rates range from about 77% to 93%, but on average the 5 year survival rate was estimated at about 90%. How old are these figures, Doc? The general range of survival 77% to 93% is over 10 years old so expect higher now. The average survival rate of 90% was as of 2010, so still quite old. Infiltrating/Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)Infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the generic type (NOS) is by far the most common breast cancer type, and represents about 78% of all cases.h"¥:For the first stage, what are the alternatives to surgery?"AFor the first stage of IdC, what are the alternatives to surgery?2VFor the first stage, what are the alternatives to surgery for invasive lobular cancer?BKILT_2091783b»Regardless of the histological subtype, the prognosis of IDC depends also on tumor size, presence of cancer in the lymph nodes, histological grade, presence of cancer in small vessels (vascular invasion), expression of hormone receptors and of oncogenes like HER2/neu. These parameters can be entered into models that provide a statistical probability of systemic spread. The probability of systemic spread is a key factor in determining whether radiation and chemotherapy are worthwhile. The individual parameters are important also because they can predict how well a cancer will respond to specific chemotherapy agents.

Stage 1 can be divided into Stage 1A and Stage 1B. The difference is determined by the size of the tumor and the lymph nodes with evidence of cancer. Stage 1A breast cancer means the following description applies: The tumor is smaller than the approximate size of a peanut (2 centimeters or smaller) AND has not spread to the lymph nodes. Stage 1B breast cancer means one of the following descriptions applies: Lymph nodes have cancer evidence with small clusters of cells between the approximate size of a pinprick to the approximate width of a grain of rice (.2mm to 2.0 mm). AND EITHER No actual tumor is found in the breast. OR The tumor is smaller than the approximate size of a peanut (2 centimeters or smaller).

Guided by imaging (ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI), cryoablation inserts a special freezing probe (a type of catheter) through the skin and to the tumor to be treated. Once the tip of the probe is in the right spot inside the tumor core, pressurized argon gas is injected through the probe into the tumor, freezing and destroying the cancerous tissue.

How can fires help an ecosystem?2 How can fires help an ecosystem?BMARCO_D358123búMany ecosystems, particularly prairie, savanna, chaparral and coniferous forests, have evolved with fire as an essential contributor to habitat vitality and renewal. [1] Many plant species in fire-affected environments require fire to germinate, establish, or to reproduce. Wildfire suppression not only eliminates these species, but also the animals that depend upon them. [2]Campaigns in the United States have historically molded public opinion to believe that wildfires are always harmful to nature. This view is based on the outdated belief that ecosystems progress toward an equilibrium and that any disturbance, such as fire, disrupts the harmony of nature. More recent ecological research has shown, however, that fire is an integral component in the function and biodiversity of many natural habitats, and that the organisms within these communities have adapted to withstand, and even to exploit, natural wildfire.h"©Give me some examples."5Give me some examples of how fires help an ecosystem.2QGive me some examples of organisms that have adapted to exploit natural wildfire.BMARCO_D1834334bNot only will the number of thriving annual plants be higher after a fire, but the number of species will also be significantly higher. This is due not only to the fact that there are more resources available but also because several plant species in chaparral biomes are so adapted to the cycle of periodic fires that their seeds are only able to sprout after a fire. Photo of a chaparral ecosystem the winter after a fire For example, the seeds of a native chaparral wildflower, called whispering bells, require smoke exposure to germinate. These annual plant species are sometimes called fire-followers because they are only seen in the first couple of years following a fire when they are a part of the dominant vegetation in a chaparral ecosystem.h"®*Cool name!

The organization group Longleaf Alliance defines a fire climax community as "a plant and animal community that is limited by and adapted to an early successional stage by frequent fire disturbances". The role of fire in the longleaf pine ecosystem was and still is today a key component in regeneration and shaping of the ecosystem. In pre-European establishment years, Native Americans set fires quite regularly. By doing so, they benefited their needs of establishing hunting grounds, homesteads, and safe havens.

Fertilizers can wash downstream, causing ""blooms"" or large populations of algae and bacteria, which can harm fish populations. In addition, Green Facts states that we are depleting fish populations in the oceans and seas, causing us to fish further offshore and deeper underwater as more and more fish disappear.

Farming is major cause of desertification - soils need time to rest between crops but pressures to provide food and an income often lead to soil and land being over used and becoming tired. Soil also requires fertilisation to remain fertile, preferably through natural or organic processes. Where farming is carried out in a way that is unsympathetic to the land in places where climatic conditions mean the soil is already under stress, this can eventually result in desertification.

Agriculture is seen to be one of the main players in the depletion of soil richness in human history. Certain agricultural practices can deplete soil of carbon, such as monoculture, failing to rotate crops sufficiently, and intensive livestock grazing. Soil that is low in carbon will not support plant life and is susceptible to desertification. Without plants, soil cannot hold water sufficiently, and will become dry and brittle over time. Agroecology is an overarching category of approaches to creating a more sustainable agricultural system and increase the health of soil. It includes "permaculture", originally being a combination of the words "permanent" and "agriculture", which is a systems thinking approach that can increase the carbon content of soil by using natural patterns in already existing ecosystems to promote a higher efficiency of food production, a lower need for human involvement, and a healthier ecosystem.h"ˇ8That sounds like organic farming.

Cats also display pica behavior in their natural environments and there is evidence to support that this behavior has a psychological aspect to it. Some breeds (such as the Siamese cat) are more predisposed to showing this type of behavior than other breeds, but several types of breeds have been documented to show pica. Cats have been observed to start by chewing and sucking on non-nutritive substances like wool, cotton, rubber, plastic and even cardboard and then progress into ingestion of these substances. This type of behavior occurs through the first four years of a cat's life but it is primarily observed during the first two months of life when cats are introduced into new homes is most common.

It is a very curious sort of behavior with a definite meaning. Directly staring at your cat can be interpreted as an aggressive behavior. This is because cats use this stare in the wild to threaten or challenge. Cats that have a friendly relationship will rarely look each other in the eyes. If they do, then they typically blink and then look away. This is their way of saying there is no threat and the relationship is one of friendship and peace. When a cat does the same to their owner it is their way of saying I do not perceive you as a threat but am comfortable with our relationship. It can also be a means of asking for further interaction.

Soy milk makers work similarly to a combination between a home blender and an automatic coffee maker. Some soy milk makers can also be programmed to make almond milk, rice milk, and other vegetable-based steeped beverages. Homemade soy milk can be made to the drinkers' tastes and nutritional requirements, providing added value. Soy pulp, a by-product of soy milk preparation, can be used as an ingredient in many recipes and food products.

Oat milk naturally has a creamy texture and a characteristically oatmeal-like flavor, though it is sold commercially in various flavor-varieties such as sweetened, unsweetened, vanilla, and chocolate. Unlike other plant milks, whose origins date as early as the 13th century, oat milk is a modern creation, developed by the Swedish scientist Rickard Oste in the early 1990s. Oats contain high amounts of functional protein, dietary fiber (Œ≤-glucan), and unsaturated fatty acids, which make oat milk a significant source of nutrients, though uncertainty surrounds its practical use as a dairy milk substitute. Regardless, oat milk is often consumed to replace dairy milk in vegan diets, or in the cases of medical conditions where dairy is incompatible, such as lactose intolerance or a cow's milk allergy (CMA).

Soymilk has 75% more antioxidants than cow‚Äôs milk. It is hearty, rich and creamy. Soy milk is good for drinking straight from the glass, poured over cereal or in coffee. The taste is nutty and slightly sweet. When it comes to cooking, soy milk is one of the best milks to choose. It can be used in place of cow‚Äôs milk in any recipe. It is stable at high temperatures which makes it a good choice for savory dishes and sauces. In baking, soy milk is also one of the best choices because of its high protein content. According to veganbaking.net curdling milk with an acid such as vinegar creates complex flavors and thickens the mixture. This in turn ‚Äúincreases leavening power and enhances the crumb quality of cakes and muffins.‚Äù Since curdling is dependent on protein content, soy milk does the best job.

History The history of anabolic steroids can be traced back to as early as 1930's, before the term steroid was even used. In the 1930's, a team of scientists was able to create a synthetic form of testosterone (a male hormone) to help treat men who were unable to produce enough of the hormone for normal growth, development, and sexual functioning. Later, during World War II it was found that this artificial form of testosterone could be used to help malnourished soldiers gain weight and improve performance. After the war, athletes began to use steroids to enhance their performance in competitions. In the 1956 Olympics, Soviet athletes, especially wrestlers, performed at exceptionally high levels. After learning that those athletes were using testosterone, an American physician (Dr. Zeigler) created a more selective form of what we know as anabolic steroids.h"—

Besides this, there are also issues regarding the negative effects that it has on the body as well as some unfortunate crime of violence that was also attributed to the use of the drug. When Was it Banned in the US? Everything started after the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul where the sprinter and steroid user Ben Johnson achieved his controversial victory.

Miller, defensive rookie of the year in 2011, is presently appealing the discipline, according to ESPN. The Denver Post reports that Miller tested positive for amphetamines and marijuana during his rookie season. Under NFL policy, a positive test for a recreational drug lands a player in a program, and a second triggers a four-game suspension. Testing positive for a performance-enhancing drug results in immediate suspension. Miller issued a denial on Twitter, saying: The NFL Players Association was not pleased that the information leaked out and George Atallah, the NFLPA‚Äôs assistant executive director of external affairs, tweeted today: If Miller fails to win on appeal, the Broncos would open the season against the Baltimore Ravens without two of their key defensive players.

In its basic format, it is played by four players in two competing partnerships, with partners sitting opposite each other around a table. Millions of people play bridge worldwide in clubs, tournaments, online and with friends at home, making it one of the world's most popular card games, particularly among seniors. The World Bridge Federation (WBF) is the governing body for international competitive bridge, with numerous other bodies governing bridge at the regional level.

There are about 20,000 genes in each cell of the human body. Together, they make up the blueprint for the human body and how it works. A person's genetic makeup is called a genotype. Information Genes are made of DNA. Strands of DNA make up part of your chromosomes. Chromosomes have matching pairs of 1 copy of a specific gene. The gene occurs in the same position on each chromosome. Genetic traits, such as eye color, are dominant or recessive: Dominant traits are controlled by 1 gene in the pair of chromosomes. Recessive traits need both genes in the gene pair to work together. Many personal characteristics, such as height, are determined by more than 1 gene. However, some diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, can be caused by a change in a single gene."≤2What other diseases are caused by a single change?"_Besides sickle cell anemia, what other diseases are caused by a single change in a single gene?2OWhat diseases besides sickle cell anemia are caused by single change in a gene?BMARCO_D1469045b∑The four types of (human) Genetic diseases are:1) Single-gene/monogenic Genetic Diseases: In this category the starting point is a mutation/change in one gene. The next question is how a change in the sequence of a single gene can cause severe disorders. Genes code for proteins which are some of the most important tools for the living beings, and also take place in the structures of the cells. The results of a mutation that happens in a part of gene that codes for a functional part of a protein are unwelcome. The protein is no more functional and as a result, many severe consequences take place. Almost 6000 single gene disorders are known and it is estimated that 1 of 200 newborns face a single gene genetic disorder. Some of these are sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, Aicardi Syndrome, Huntington‚Äôs disease."è%What are the other types of diseases?"UBesides sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis, what are the other types of diseases?2EWhat are the other types of human genetic diseases besides monogenic?BMARCO_D1469045b≥3) Chromosomal Genetic Diseases: Chromosomes are big DNA molecules composed from genes. The chromosomes are located in the cell nucleus. Abnormalities in the structure, number (and not only) of the chromosomes can cause some of the most dangerous genetic disorders. This type of disorders seem to be much easier to observe because they are, sometimes, detected by examination with microscope. Down Syndrome is the most well known disease caused by chromosomal abnormalities. In this disorder there is a third copy of chromosome 21 (there are two copies of each chromosome in the cells of healthy humans).

With CRISPR, the California researchers added a set of genes conferring malaria resistance to their mutant mosquitoes, as well as a powerful tool called a ‚Äúgene drive‚Äù that guarantees that all of the mosquitoes‚Äô descendants would inherit their resistance. [Why we should all hope to get bitten by a GMO mosquito] ‚ÄúGene drives‚Äù work by manipulating the laws of genetics so that the desired genes are copied onto both of an offspring‚Äôs chromosomes when a mutant mates with a wild mosquito. Ordinarily, offspring get just half their traits from each parent ‚Äî but with the mutant inserting its DNA into both chromosomes, mosquitoes with the gene drive were able to pass on the resistance to 99.5 percent of their offspring, the researchers say. According to the New York Times, the gene drive has the potential to spread malaria resistance throughout a wild population in a matter of just 10 mosquito generations, or a single summer. Kevin Esvelt, an evolutionary engineer at Harvard University who studies the technique in yeast and wasn‚Äôt involved in the mosquito study, called the research a ‚Äúmajor advance.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis work suggests that we‚Äôre a hop, skip and jump away from actual gene drive candidates for eventual release,‚Äù he told the Associated Press, For now, the mutant mosquitoes are being kept in a highly secure lab behind a series of locked doors.h"É	No, I meant in humans."No, I meant in humans.2fNo, What long-term effects are researchers worried about with CRISPR editing in human germ-line cells?BWAPO_66HYS24A4VFDRIOJNX4HKKGJRAb√That could be for the better, but quite possibly for the worse, since the interrelated genetic functions developed over the long history of evolution remain unknown, despite the advances Baltimore notes.

This has already been successfully used to target important genes in many cell lines and organisms, including human (34), bacteria (41), zebrafish (32), C. elegans (42), plants (34), Xenopus tropicalis (43), yeast (44), Drosophila (45), monkeys (46), rabbits (47), pigs (42), rats (48) and mice (49). Several groups have now taken advantage of this method to introduce single point mutations (deletions or insertions) in a particular target gene, via a single g RNA (14, 21, 29). Using a pair of g RNA-directed Cas9 nucleases instead, it is also possible to induce large deletions or genomic rearrangements, such as inversions or translocations (50).h" 	GI‚Äôve heard a lot about RNA recently.

And How Can It Be Used to Turn Genes ‚ÄòOff‚Äô? June 13, 2016 | Matt Shipman CRISPR systems have been a hot research topic since they were shown to have utility as genetic engineering tools in 2012. And they‚Äôre often explained in a way that most folks can understand. But those explanations often overlook key details ‚Äì like the fact that scientists are still in the process of discovering the fundamental rules of how these systems work. For example, here‚Äôs a simplified explanation: CRISPR-Cas systems protect bacteria from invaders such as viruses. They do this by creating small strands of RNA that match DNA sequences specific to a given invader. When those CRISPR RNAs find a match, they unleash Cas proteins that chop up the invader‚Äôs DNA, preventing it from replicating. But of course it‚Äôs more complex than that. For example, there are six different types of CRISPR systems (that we know of). One of the most widely-studied CRISPR systems is CRISPR-Cas9, which is a Type II CRISPR system."ı

Recently published findings from a team of researchers at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester, Mass., suggest that a modified form of this CRISPR gene-editing technology may eventually result in a cure for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), a form of the disease that leads to progressive muscular degeneration in the face, shoulder blades and upper arms. The new CRISPR technique works by silencing the gene (DUX4) thought to be responsible for the genetic disease. Once you ‚Äúturn off‚Äù the gene, it can no longer encode for the toxic proteins that lead to the deterioration of human skeletal muscle. Unlike other CRISPR techniques that focus on editing a troublesome gene, this modified approach focuses on repressing the gene. As Dr. Charis Himeda of the University of Massachusetts Medical School told me in a conversation, this technique is a ‚Äúnon-cutting version of CRISPR‚Äù that involves the dCas9 protein rather than the Cas9 protein.h"òIThe developments sound exciting.

This means that if you are on a 2,000-calorie diet, you need to get 200 to 700 calories from protein every day. There are 4 calories in each gram of protein, so divide the calories by 4 to convert them to grams of protein. This amounts to 50 to 175 grams of protein, based on 2,000 calories, which gives you 2 to 7 percent of the recommended amount of daily protein.

Section::::Perspectives. The Southeast African Great Lakes region has a long-standing tribal history of traditional medicine and practices. Although some slight progress has been made with the availability of mental health resources in these areas, still many people in rural Southeast Africa utilize traditional methods to treat mental illness. According to Vikram Patel, a global mental health expert and professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the stigmatization of mental illness is due to traditional and cultural methods of dealing with these situations and can only be changed through improved support, education, and greater awareness. In traditional Southeast Africa, when there is a situation in which there is a mental health concern, the patient is usually treated without their consent. For example, if the patient is violent or destructive, he is sedated by the traditional healer or by family members in order to commence therapy, and people are often isolated or treated against their will in order to prevent patients from hurting themselves or others.h"œ

It was found that 45% of the black patients that attended a community mental health clinic had consulted a healer for their problem. Additionally, 26% were simultaneously seeking treatment from both the traditional healers and the psychiatrists. Traditional healers are often instrumental in treating mental illness. Psychological healing relies more on a cultural and emotional understanding than it does on possessing medical knowledge. In an interview, Dr. Mustafa Elmasri, a Gaza psychologist with over twenty years of experience describes how he has often collaborated with African Traditional Medicine. Instead of labelling traditional healers as primitive and demonic, he worked with them and even trained some of them in scientific methods for identifying certain mental illnesses such as epilepsy and psychosis. Dr. Elmasri found that "traditional healers were the key partner beyond the patients and their families in gaining an understanding of the psychological experience and access to social support structures". Beliefs are fundamental to behaviour, and therefore a deeper understanding of traditional medicine will help to improve the effectiveness of psychological care.h"Õ	)Okay.

Stigma comes from negative and incorrect beliefs, or stereotypes, about groups of people. Fear of being left out or picked on because of who you are is a part of stigma. The effects of stigma can make you feel sad, ashamed or alone. People with mental health challenges sometimes experience stigma. They get called ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù or ‚Äúmental‚Äù or ‚Äúemo.‚Äù These labels are based on stereotypes, not on fact. You can help break down stigma by learning and sharing the truth about mental health.

Vietnamese don‚Äôt readily accept Western mental health counseling and interventions, particularly when self-disclosure is expected. However, it is possible to accept assistance if trust has been gained. Russian immigrants frequently view U. S. medical care with a degree of mistrust. The Russian experience with medical practitioners has been an authoritarian relationship in which free exchange of information and open discussion was not usual. As a result, many Russian patients find it difficult to question a physician and to talk openly about medical concerns.

In many European vernacular literatures, Christian poetry appears among the earliest monuments of those literatures, and Biblical paraphrases in verse often precede Bible translations. In Old English poetry, the "Dream of the Rood", a meditation on Christ's crucifixion which adapts Germanic heroic imagery and applies it to Jesus, is one of the earliest extant monuments of Old English literature. Dante Alighieri's "The Divine Comedy" represents one of the earliest monuments of Italian vernacular literature. Much Old Irish poetry was the work of Irish monks and is on religious themes. This story is repeated in most European languages. Modern Christian poetry especially suffers from a difficulty of definition. The writings of a Christian poet are not necessarily classified as Christian poetry.h"Ç

The influence of Christianity on poetry has been great in any area that Christianity has taken hold. Christian poems often directly reference the Bible, while others provide allegory. Section::::Overview of Christian poetry. Poetic forms have been used by Christians since the recorded history of the faith begins. The earliest Christian poetry, in fact, appears in the New Testament. Canticles such as the "Magnificat" and "Nunc Dimittis", which appear in the Gospel of Luke, take the Biblical poetry of the psalms of the Hebrew Bible as their models. Many Biblical scholars also believe that St Paul of Tarsus quotes bits of early Christian hymns in his epistles. Passages such as Philippians 2:5-11 (following) are thought by many Biblical scholars to represent early Christian hymns that were being quoted by the Apostle: Within the world of classical antiquity, Christian poets often struggled with their relationship to the existing traditions of Greek and Latin poetry, which were of course heavily influenced by paganism."î

Some early Christian poets such as Ausonius continued to include allusions to pagan deities and standard classical figures and allusions continued to appear in his verse. Other Christian poems of the late Roman Empire, such as the "Psychomachia" of Prudentius, cut back on allusions to Greek mythology, but continue the use of inherited classical forms. Other early Christian poets were more innovative. The hymnodist Venantius Fortunatus wrote a number of important poems that are still used in the liturgy of the Roman Catholic Church, such as the "Vexilla Regis" ("The Royal Standard") and "Pange, lingua, gloriosi proelium certaminis" ("Sing, O my tongue, of the glorious struggle"). From a literary and linguistic viewpoint, these hymns represent important innovations; they turn away from Greek prosody and instead seem to have been based on the rhythmic marching songs of Roman armies.h"á

Section::::History and origins. Beginning with the migration of Muhammad and his followers to Mecca (A.D. 622), also known as the Hijrah, the quasida or ode was a sharp contrast to the sacred Quran. Writers at the time of pre-Islamic poetry were considered to be lacking the knowledge and authority necessary to be writing such poetry, thus leading this period of time to be called the ‚ÄúAge of Ignorance‚Äù. This time period caused tension amongst the early Islamic world, since the ode style of writing was seen as profane to the sacred text of the Quran. Islamic poetry is very important and it is a heritage passed from generation to generation. These poems and features examine Muslim faith and Islamic culture and address important events, holidays, and occasions such as Ramadan. These poets explore a range of spiritual, literary, and political concerns from the 6th century to the present day. Also, Islamic poetry was found centuries ago."‹

How does the use of rhyme in Biblical poetry compare to the use of rhyme in Islamic poetry?BMARCO_D164007b‡The Arabs have always used rhymes extensively, most notably in their long, rhyming qasidas. Some classical poetry forms, such as Venpa of the Tamil language, had rigid grammars (to the point that they could be expressed as a context-free grammar), which ensured a rhythm. Alliteration played a key role in structuring early Germanic and English forms of poetry (called alliterative verse), akin to the role of rhyme in later European poetry. The alliterative patterns of early Germanic poetry and the rhyme schemes of Modern European poetry alike both include meter as a key part of their structure, which determines when the listener expects instances of rhyme or alliteration to occur. In this sense, both alliteration and rhyme, when used in poetic structures, help to emphasise and define a rhythmic pattern. By contrast, the chief device of Biblical poetry in ancient Hebrew was parallelism, a rhetorical structure in which successive lines reflected each other in grammatical structure, sound structure, notional content, or all three; a verse form that lent itself to antiphonal or call- and-response performance.h"Í

KILT_22926bƒ	Tonal languages include Chinese, Vietnamese and most Subsaharan languages. Metrical rhythm generally involves precise arrangements of stresses or syllables into repeated patterns called feet within a line. In Modern English verse the pattern of stresses primarily differentiate feet, so rhythm based on meter in Modern English is most often founded on the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables (alone or elided). In the classical languages, on the other hand, while the metrical units are similar, vowel length rather than stresses define the meter. Old English poetry used a metrical pattern involving varied numbers of syllables but a fixed number of strong stresses in each line. The chief device of ancient Hebrew Biblical poetry, including many of the psalms, was "parallelism", a rhetorical structure in which successive lines reflected each other in grammatical structure, sound structure, notional content, or all three. Parallelism lent itself to antiphonal or call-and-response performance, which could also be reinforced by intonation. Thus, Biblical poetry relies much less on metrical feet to create rhythm, but instead creates rhythm based on much larger sound units of lines, phrases and sentences.h"ãÅAhh, it seems like rhyming and parallelism share similar functions.

In modern literary traditions the boundaries of poetry are very broad (free verse, prose poetry, etc.), and some works may be described both as prose and poetry. Section::::Arabic culture and influences. In classic Arabic literature the rhymed prose is called "saj'". An elaborate Arabic kind of rhymed prose is "maqama". It influenced other cultures of the Muslim world, such as Persian (as exemplified by Saadi's "Gulestan") and Turkish (). "Maqama" also influenced the medieval Hebrew literature, a significant amount of which was produced by Jews of the Muslim world. It influenced the style of Yehuda Alharizi, Ibn Zabara, Ibn Hasdai (Abraham ben Samuel ha-Levi ibn Hasdai), Ibn Sahula, Jacob ben Eleazer.

It was pioneered by Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto, and it was developed by the Haskalah movements, that saw poetry as the most quality genre for Hebrew writing. The first Haskalah poet, who heavily influenced the later poets, was Naphtali Hirz Wessely, at the end of the 18th Century, and after him came Shalom HaCohen, Max Letteris, Abraham Dob B√§r Lebensohn, his son Micah Joseph, Judah Leib Gordon and others. Haskalah poetry was greatly influenced by the contemporary European poetry, as well as the poetry of the previous ages, especially Biblical poetry and pastoralism. It was mostly a didactic form of poetry, and dealt with the world, the public, and contemporary trends, but not the individual. A secular Galician Jew, Naftali Herz Imber, wrote the lyrics to HaTikva in 1878; this later became the national anthem of Israel. In the age after the Haskalah, many prominent poets were associated with Hovevei Zion. They included Shaul Tchernihovsky and Haim Nahman Bialik, who would later be considered Israel's national poet.

It raised and managed funds for the movement, established a legal aid service made up of volunteers, and coordinated help lines to align efforts across the country. Nigeria‚Äôs Feminist Coalition capitalizes on mobile apps Communication technologies have facilitated the #EndSARS protests. The online mobilization effort has garnered global support, generating over 28 million tweets within 48 hours of the online campaign‚Äôs kickoff on Oct. 8. The speed and reach of new technologies have enabled efficient communication of information for community building and collaboration. These technologies also helped the #EndSARS movement navigate the Nigerian government‚Äôs responses to the protests. Through WhatsApp and Twitter, activists shared information, reaching a wide network of supporters. Real-time transmission of texts, pictures and videos of the protests and violence by police and soldiers also prompted swift domestic and international condemnation of the Nigerian government.h"«	_There was mention of the protection of Black lives earlier.

My book, ‚ÄúCivil Rights and the Making of the Modern American State,‚Äù examined an earlier movement focused on the protection of black lives. I studied archival materials of the battle by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) against lynching and mob violence from 1909 to 1923. My research showed how the NAACP raised public awareness, met with American presidents, secured the support of Members of Congress, and won a consequential criminal justice victory in the Supreme Court. Drawing from the book‚Äôs findings, we can identify three key things to know about ongoing #BlackLivesMatter protests: 1. The fight to protect black lives from unjust state violence has deep historical roots Some people, including Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, have expressed confusion as to why protesters believe recent police misconduct is emblematic of a system of racial injustice and not just a few bad apples. For many blacks, what is happening right now is not new; it is grounded in a documented history of state violence against black citizens.h"„

Monthly salaries for fashion designers vary widely, based on employer, experience, location and talent. Fashion designers search for inspiration to sketch, cut and sew fabrics into the next big trend in clothing. Designers might work for a clothing company or design firm, or might work independently and start their own company. According to the Fashion Designer Salary Data website, the average salary range for most fashion designers is between $50,000 and $80,000 a year, which equates to $4,167 and $6,667 a month. Most fashion designers earn about $65,000 annually, or $5,417 per month. Some designers earn considerably more, especially those who own their own successful fashion design company and design clothes for wealthy people and celebrities. They can easily make a few million dollars each year, or hundreds of thousands a month."”	How can I get a degree in it?")How can I get a degree in fashion design?2&How can I get a fashion design degree?BMARCO_D1812231b The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that a bachelor's degree related to fashion design is usually needed to gain an entry-level position in the industry ( www.bls.gov ). A common type of degree is the Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA), which may have a major in fashion or fashion design. You might also get to pursue a specialization, such as knitwear, intimate apparel, visual merchandising, textiles, special occasion wear or children's wear. BFA Program Requirements A BFA program in fashion or fashion design provides you with opportunities to study in-depth topics through electives or core curriculum, and studio courses give you hands-on experience. In addition to studying fashion, you might also take courses in business or merchandising. Although your chosen specialization can affect your program's curriculum requirements, common topics of study include the following:2-D and 3-D fashion design Fashion drawing Sewing techniques Art and fashion history Fashion color Textiles Fashion draping Before you graduate, you will usually create a portfolio and complete an internship.h"ï1Okay.

What does the Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in fashion portfolio usually consist of?BKILT_7428553bø	A typical type of a portfolio is one used by artists. An artist's portfolio consists of artwork that the artist can take to job interviews, conferences, galleries, and other networking opportunities to showcase his or her work, and give others an idea of what type of genre the artist works in. Art Portfolios, sometimes called "artfolios", can be a variety of sizes, and usually consist of approximately ten to twenty photographs of the artist's best works. Some artists create multiple portfolios to showcase different styles and to apply for different types of jobs. For instance, one portfolio may be mainly for doing technical illustrations and another may be for surreal painting or sculpture. Models and actors often use electronic portfolios to showcase their career with a digital display of their photos, biographies and skills. Talent portfolios can also include video. Animators typically use demo reels, also known as "demo tapes", in place of or in addition to portfolios to demonstrate their skills to potential employers. Demo tapes have historically been short VHS tapes, but most are now DVDs. Demo reels are normally less than two minutes in length and showcase some of the animator's best works.h"±6What are the common entry requirements for the degree?"HWhat are the common entry requirements for the degree in fashion design?2KWhat are the common entry requirements for a Bachelor of Fine Arts program?BMARCO_D1965125bÀ	Education &amp; Training Required Fashion designers typically need an associate or a bachelor's degree in fashion design. Some fashion designers also combine a fashion design degree with a business, marketing, or fashion merchandising degree, especially those who want to run their own business or retail store. Basic coursework includes color, textiles, sewing and tailoring, pattern making, fashion history, computer-aided design (CAD), and design of different types of clothing such as menswear or footwear. Coursework in human anatomy, mathematics, and psychology also is useful. The National Association of Schools of Art and Design accredits approximately 300 postsecondary institutions with programs in art and design. Most of these schools award degrees in fashion design. Many schools do not allow formal entry into a program until a student has successfully completed basic art and design courses. Applicants usually have to submit sketches and other examples of their artistic ability. Aspiring fashion designers can learn these necessary skills through internships with design or manufacturing firms. Some designers also gain valuable experience working in retail stores, as personal stylists, or as custom tailors.h"ÛBI‚Äôll consider those.

Fashion merchandising bachelor's degrees are another option for those aspiring to enter all fashion journalism fields. Because the job markets in the fashion and journalism industries can be competitive, you may want to pursue a college internship in your professional area of interest. Some journalism degree programs may offer concentrations in fashion or magazine writing; the latter may be appropriate for those aspiring to work for fashion magazines. If you pursue a degree in general journalism, one or several fashion writing classes are likely available to you. Some schools may also offer special seminars, clubs or other activities for journalism students interested in fashion. Fashion journalism courses or concentrations teach you about relevant general and journalism-specific concepts, such as visual merchandising, textiles, fashion marketing, event reporting, trend analysis and designer collection reviews.

These and related courses lay the basic framework for understanding veterinary medicine. Some courses might be specific to an animal group. The third year may focus on clinical studies in which students come in to contact with living animals and practice using the knowledge and skills they've gained in the previous two years to make diagnoses and recommend possible treatments. The fourth year is usually spent participating in applied experiences, such as practicums or externships. Get involved in research projects.

What could be wrong?BMARCO_D2718477bßThis was cause for concern and we were going to check his ears when we got home. He kept shaking and shaking ... and then we saw an ant waltz out of his ear. There was our culprit. The shaking stopped. When an especially mean stray tick got on Jasmine's ear, her instinct was to shake her head. (Stray tick because it was one of the only two we ever found at the ranch.) The bite was painful for Jasmine though, so every time she started to shake her head she'd cry a little, stop and hold her head down, tilted towards the affected ear. This immediately alerted us to a problem and we found and removed the invader. When your dog starts shaking their head like that, examine the ears, eyes, head, neck and skin carefully. Pay particularly close attention to the ears. Some culprits are obvious and easy to deal with. Some require attention of your veterinarian. A common cause of head shaking is otitis, inflammation of the ear canal.h"¥

Inflammation can occur for any reason such as infection, allergy, parasitic infestation, tumors or any injury. Inflammation is an acute (immediate) response of the body towards any pathological (disease) condition, thus swelling as a characteristic of inflammation may be the result of any dog ear problem. Another common cause of dog swollen ear is a hematoma. Canine ear hematoma refers to the accumulation of fluids and blood in between the skin and cartilage of the ear. Most of the time it occurs over the flap of the ear, but it may also occur in the inner cavities of the ear. Hematomas may cause inflammation as a secondary character, which means as a result of another condition. Hematomas are caused by any mechanical injury or vigorous head shakes, which are also related to the underlying ear problem."¢How dangerous could these be?"%How dangerous could dog hematomas be?2RHow dangerous could the inflammation or canine ear hematoma in my dog‚Äôs ears be?BMARCO_D2860251bÒEach hospital is different though and you should talk with the veterinarians in your area. Hematomas don't just appear. There is a problem that caused it. The most common is an ear infection but it can also be rough play with another dog or trauma. If the hematoma reaches the base of the ear and you let it heal naturally it can close off the ear canal and condemn your dog to chronic and painful ear infections. If it is just at the tip then you are looking at an aesthetic change only and it's not as much of a concern. The cause of the hematoma still needs to be addressed though. The healing process can take anywhere from 2-12 weeks depending on if the dog keeps re-injuring it.

This can be repeated on a daily basis until the infection clears up. Garlic has also been found to be a good home remedy because of the herb‚Äôs antibiotic properties. One just needs to mash two cloves of garlic with a cup of olive oil and let it sit for two weeks. After two weeks, strain the mixture and warm it up a bit. Then place 2 to 3 drops of oil in the infected ear until the infection clears-up. This is a good remedy if a dog is prone to frequent infections because of the time it takes to make. However, if one does not have the premade solution on hand, oil from a garlic gel capsule can be used. If a dog‚Äôs ear infection does not seem to get better with the use of home remedies, consult a veterinarian (traditional or holistic).h"ÿHMy cat is also having similar symptoms.

Garlic and Olive Oil combined are great for treating ear mites. Crush garlic and soak it overnight in warm olive oil. Throw away the clove and warm up the olive oil. Add 5 drops to each ear for 21 days. This remedy also smothers the ear mites. My favorite is Aloe and Calendula essential oils. They are very soothing to the kitty‚Äôs ears and have worked wonders for getting rid of the ear mites. Both oils are available at your local health food store.

Michael‚Äôs nose was the source of his early nickname, as Jermaine‚Äôs acne was for him. The Jacksons had been subject to intense media scrutiny starting when they were very young and that meant Michael had to go through puberty in the public eye, a process that included media scrutiny of his blemishes. Nancy Leiviska, who worked with MTV, set Jermaine and Michael up with a dermatologist, and both Jacksons became vegetarians in an effort to fight acne through their diets.

During his performances Michael would appear on stage or on videos showing only some parts of his body that were not affected. Whenever he went out, he usually shielded himself from sunlight to protect his skin. As years past by, Michael‚Äôs skin just became lighter and lighter in color.

White, fragrant flowers have appeared, followed by cherry-like fruit, each containing two seeds: Arabica coffee beans, the most popular in the world. But last month, the worst drought in decades hit Brazil's coffee belt region, destroying crop yields and causing the price of coffee to shoot up by more than 50 percent so far this year. The drought is historic, with more than 140 cities in Brazil forced to ration water. The country's leading newspapers reported that some neighborhoods are receiving water only every three days. For now, retail prices for coffee are stable. Roasters typically have enough supplies to cover themselves for a few months. But if the price of the Arabica (pronounced uh-RAB-ick-uh) beans continues to rise, consumers could start seeing the cost of their morning coffee creep up later this year, according to Jack Scoville, a futures market analyst specializing in grains and coffee, among other commodities."•	What caused the drought?"-What caused the drought in Brazil last month?29What caused the drought in Brazil‚Äôs coffee belt region?BMARCO_D3034769båDeforestation causing S√£o Paulo drought Written by Chris Fitch Published in Cities Deforestation near S√£o Paulo, Brazil AFNR05 Feb 2015Brazil possesses 12 per cent of the world‚Äôs freshwater, and yet S√£o Paulo ‚Äì the biggest and richest city in South America ‚Äì is suffering from severe drought with deforestation getting the blame Water rationing.

Young lesions appear as chlorotic or pale yellow spots some millimetres in diameter, the older being a few centimetres in diameter.

Still, there are even reasons to think that these efforts will be futile. ""Coffee doesn't have a very broad genetic base,""Lombardini says. ""It originated from just a few plants that were taken out of Ethiopia a few hundred years ago, so it has a very narrow, homogenous genome. ""This means that finding variations that might allow for rust-resistance will be difficult. Even if they're identified, a mutation in the fungus' genome could easily allow it to conquer the resistant plants. "" My worry is that producers will over-plant this variety and when the inevitable mutant rust strain capable of infecting it arrives, we will be back to where we are now,"" Arneson says.

Aficionados claim that this brand of high-intensity workouts is a fast and fun way to get fit. Critics say that it‚Äôs a fast track to injury.

A typical ‚Äúworkout of the day‚Äù (WOD) might consist of running 400 meters, then doing 21 kettlebell swings and 12 pull-ups before repeating this sequence two more times. One recent WOD gave participants 20 minutes to complete as many rounds as possible of 10 push-ups, 20 pull-ups and 30 lunges. Besides the intensity factor, what distinguishes CrossFit from other gym-based workouts is its constantly changing exercises and emphasis on moves ‚Äî bending and squatting, for example ‚Äî that are functional in everyday life, says Russell Berger, a head trainer for CrossFit Inc.

Your body will be working overtime - even after you are done exercising - to replace this lost energy which will result in more calories burned. The body adapts under intensity so the harder you push yourself the more your body adapts to being able to function at higher intensities. Ease into it working up to going ‚Äúall out‚Äù and increasing the number of intervals you do. Mix it up with longer (60 sec. to 5 min.) and shorter (20-60 sec.) intervals - followed by a short recovery period (half the duration of the intense time)Interval training will work as long as you are supporting it with good nutrition. Choosing meals full of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins and healthy fats. Split your meals into six smaller meals spread throughout the day to increase your metabolism. Remember to eat before you exercise - eating before training gives your body the ability to exercise harder.

Many athletes now use fasting as means to hitting low body fat percentages for competitions.2. Fasting Improves Insulin Sensitivity Fasting has shown to have a positive effect on insulin sensitivity, allowing you to tolerate carbohydrates (sugar) better than if you didn‚Äôt fast. A study showed that after periods of fasting, insulin becomes more effective in telling cells to take up glucose from blood.3. Fasting Speeds Up The Metabolism Intermittent fasting gives your digestive system a rest, and this can energise your metabolism to burn through calories more efficiently. If your digestion is poor, this can effect your ability to metabolise food and burn fat. Intermittent fasts can regulate your digestion and promote healthy bowel function, thus improving your metabolic function.4. Fasting Promotes Longevity Believe it or not, the less you eat the longer you will live.

It‚Äôs one less decision you have to make every day. It could allow you to enjoy bigger portioned meals (thus making your tastebuds and stomach satiated) and STILL eat fewer calories on average. It requires less time (and potentially less money). Rather than having to prepare or purchase three to six meals a day, you only need to prepare two meals. Instead of stopping what you‚Äôre doing six times a day to eat, you simply only have to stop to eat twice. Rather than having to do the dishes six times, you only have to do them twice. Rather than having to purchase six meals a day, you only need to purchase two. It promotes stronger insulin sensitivity and increased growth hormone secretion, two keys for weight loss and muscle gain. Intermittent fasting helps you create a double whammy for weight loss and building a solid physique. It can level up your brain, including positively counteracting conditions like Parkinson‚Äôs, Alzheimer‚Äôs, and dementia.

Discover the Mesozoic Era In this article, we ask ‚ÄòWhen were dinosaurs alive?‚Äô and explore the different periods of the Mesozoic Era. This article is part of our Dinosaur Facts series. When Were Dinosaurs Alive? Dinosaurs first appeared between 243 and 231 million years ago. This was during the Triassic period, which is part of the ‚Äògeological timescale‚Äô. We‚Äôll take a closer look at the geological timescale further down the page. Dinosaurs lived on Earth for many millions of years. In fact, they were alive right up to the end of the Cretaceous period, around 66 million years ago. This means that dinosaurs were alive for as long as 177 million years, for much of the Triassic period, and for all of the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. A simple dinosaur timescale at the end of this article shows when dinosaurs were alive.

The Mesozoic lasted from 245 to 65 million years ago, and is divided into three periods. The Mesozoic, which derives its name from the Greek with a rough meaning of middle animals, began after the Permian extinction and ended with the Cretaceous extinction. It comprises the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods. The Mesozoic is most famed for the Dinosaurs, and popular lexicon considers it the Age of the Dinosaurs (or Reptiles). The dinosaurs together with reptiles of all sizes ranging from the gigantic to the merely intimidating by human size standards, dominated the terrestrial environments. The flowering plants, or angiosperms, appeared in the Mesozoic. Importantly, by the end of the Mesozoic, the body plans and corresponding genetic developmental blueprints that define modern life forms were in place, although mammalian avian forms were still quite primitive.

There were features of the Earth's geology and fossil record which could not be explained e.g. Similar fossils of extinct plants and animals were found on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean* *It had been suggested that these continents were once linked by land bridges that had sunk, or washed away or just covered in water as the Earth cooled and contracted and sea levels rose. Also, the fact that geographically the continent of Africa seem to fit quite neatly into the shore line of the South America continent. PLATE TECTONICS THEORY: The Earth's lithosphere (the crust and the upper part of the mantle) is cracked into a number of large pieces called tectonic plates, you can think of them as giant rock rafts floating on the 'plastic' mantle. These plates (like big rock rafts) are less dense than the mantle and so float on it and constantly move at relative speeds of a few centimetres per year as a result of convection currents within the Earth's mantle.h"§	9What was it like during the time dinosaurs were on earth?"9What was it like during the time dinosaurs were on earth?27What was earth's landmass like during the Mesozoic era?BMARCO_D394092b·Dinosaurs Dinosaurs were a group of animals that ruled our world for about 150 million years. They lived during the geologic middle ages of the Earth‚Äôs history, in a time that is called the Mesozoic era. Dinosaurs were reptiles and belonged to the greatest animals on Earth. The Age of Dinosaurs The Mesozoic era is often called the Age of Dinosaurs. It began about 250 million years ago and ended about 65 million years ago. Geologists divide it into 3 parts:the Triassicthe Jurassicthe Cretaceous During the Mesozoic period the Earth consisted of only one single mass of land. About 200 million years ago this huge continent, Pangaea, broke into many pieces, which started to drift apart. Continents moved slowly into the position they are today. The climate during the Age of Dinosaurs was different than today‚Äôs. It was warmer and there was more vegetation. The land was full of swamps, green plains, rivers and lakes.

From the evidence available, scientists have reconstructed a predecessor, termed Pannotia, that may have formed about 600 mya, before dividing again some 50 million years later. Another, earlier hypothesized supercontinent is Rodinia, believed to have formed approximately 1,100 mya and divided 750 mya. Tentative evidence suggests that the Columbia (supercontinent) existed between 1.8 and 1.5 billion years ago. There is also some evidence for an even earlier supercontinent named Kenorland, existing between ~2.7 billion years to ~2.1 billion years ago, and Earth's possibly first supercontinent named Vaalbara, existing between ~3.3 billion years to ~2.8 billion years ago.

You mentioned three periods in the Mesosoic Era. What was characteristic about the Triassic Period?BMARCO_D1693145b≥It was during the Triassic period that archosaurs (""ruling reptiles""), including dinosaurs, crocodiles, and Pterosaurs first evolved. Prior to the Triassic, during the previous Permian era, mammal-like reptiles had been the dominant land animals. Some survived into the Triassic, but they dramatically declined, apparently out-competed by the dinosaurs. The mammal-like reptiles did however give rise to the first mammals, these being tiny mouse-sized animals. The dominant plants during the Triassic period were conifers, ferns, ginkgos and horsetails. Here is a map of the world during the early Triassic (about 225 million years ago). At this time, all the continents were combined into one massive super-continent, known as Pangaea: The different geography of the world also led to a different climate. On the whole, the Triassic was generally hot and dry, and there was no glaciation or ice caps at the poles (polar regions were moist and temperate). The interior of Pangaea would have had a highly seasonal continental climate, with very hot summers and cold winters.h"ÃWhat about the second?"#What about the second dinosaur era?22What was characteristic about the Jurassic Period?BMARCO_D2877122bƒThe Jurassic Period ‚Äì 199 to 145.5 million years ago Enter the middle period of the Mesozoic Era. In this period, land was breaking up into separate continents. There were new kinds of forests and all the plants that exist today. Species of dinosaurs had become extinct and new species had appeared. Among them was Dilophosaurus [ image] which is estimated to have existed to about 194 million years ago. It is believed to have been about 20 feet in length and to have weighed about 1,000 pounds. Another species of dinosaur was Brachiosaurus [ image ], one of the biggest land animals yet found. It has been described as having been as tall as 52 feet and as eating herbs, leaves and fruits from the tops of trees. It is described as having existed as long ago as 156 million years and becoming extinct by 145 million years ago.

During this period the continents had separated, but Australia and Antarctica were still joined. Each continent had its own flora and fauna. There were now flowering plants such as magnolias and waterlilies. Around 115 million years ago a bird-like creature with wings of skin rather than feathers, a pterosaur, was in the skies over what today is Brazil. It had a wingspan of five meters (16.4 feet) and when standing its shoulders were about one meter (39.37 inches) from the ground. Among the last of the non-flying dinosaurs was Tyrannosaurus Rex, or T-Rex as it has been called [ image ]. It is believed to have lived from approximately 68 to 65 million years ago.

Most dinosaur species lived and died out during this period, but at the end of the Cretaceous period (65 million years ago), all remaining types of dinosaurs (with the exception of birds which had already evolved, and are widely believed to be descended from dinosaurs) died out. At the same time many other creatures (for example Ammonites , and Belemnites , as well as Pterosaurs , and many large marine reptiles such as Mosasaurs . Plesiosaurs and Pliosaurs ) also became extinct. In fact, all animals weighing more than 55 pounds (25 kilograms) seem to have died out! While are not sure what happened, we do know that something happened at about 65 million years ago. This event shows up as clear boundary in the rocks, known as the ""K-T boundary"", the extinction event usually being referrred to as the ""Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction"". Scientists have proposed many different possible explanations for what may have happened, and why this mass extinction might have happened: (Note: Sometimes these suggested explanations are informally called ""theories"", however in this case ""hypotheses"" is the correct term, since in science a theory means a well-substantiated explanation of some natural phenomenon or observation, whereas as ""hypothesis"" means a suggested explanation which needs to be tested against experimental evidence).h"ƒ

But the fact is that dinosaur diversity reached its peak in the ensuing Cretaceous period. Geography and Climate During the Jurrasic Period The Jurassic period witnessed the breakup of the Pangaean supercontinent into two big pieces, Gondwana in the south (corresponding to modern-day Africa, South America, Australia, and Antarctica) and Laurasia in the north (Eurasia and North America). At about the same time, intra-continental lakes and rivers formed that opened new evolutionary niches for aquatic and terrestrial life. The climate was hot and humid, with steady rainfall, ideal conditions for the explosive spread of lush, green plants. Terrestrial Life During the Jurassic Period Dinosaurs: During the Jurassic period, relatives of the small, quadrupedal, plant-eating prosauropods of the Triassic period gradually evolved into multi-ton sauropods like Brachiosaurus and Diplodocus. This period also saw the concurrent rise of medium- to large-sized theropod dinosaurs like Allosaurus and Megalosaurus. This helps explain the evolution of the earliest, armor-bearing ankylosaurs and stegosaurs. Mammals: The mouse-sized early mammals of the Jurassic period, only recently evolved from their Triassic ancestors, kept a low profile, scurrying around at night or nesting high up in trees so as not to get squashed under the feet of bigger dinosaurs.h"ì

We all realize that the dinosaurs onscreen are lifelike, but not realistic. They look the way movie watchers want dinosaurs to look, not the way scientists truly believe they looked. [‚ÄòI enjoyed the whole absurdity of it': Paleontologists review ‚ÄòJurassic World.‚Äô] But in reality, paleontologists seem to have a soft spot for the books and movies. Why? Because the love of dinosaurs they inspired back in the early '90s arguably changed the research field forever. "There was a wonderful explosion in interest after that first movie," Matthew Mossbrucker, director and chief curator of the Morrison Natural History Museum, told The Post. "I really think it's partially responsible for giving me a career." After screening "Jurassic World" with a Post reporter, two paleontologists from The Smithsonian had similar thoughts.

All cathedrals, including the Duomo Cathedral of Florence, are designed with four perpendicular arms so that the entire building has the shape of a cross, symbolizing the crucifixion of Christ. The long arms running from west to east are called the nave, and the shorter ones from north to south are the transept. The area where the nave and transept meet is called the crossing. Historical Background During the time when the Duomo was built, Italy was full of city-states, or cities operating as independent governments, that were building up new wealth from international trade. As such, they were constantly competing with each other.

This was entirely new for churches and made the inside feel extremely spacious. Although the entire cathedral is incredible, the most famous architectural feature is the dome, called the cupola in Italian. Around 1417, the building commission awarded Filippo Brunelleschi and Lorenzo Ghiberti the task of building a dome on the top of the cathedral. Ghiberti ended up dropping out of the project because he was working on another part of the cathedral. Brunelleschi was facing a monumental task. The area that the dome had to cover, the 140-foot crossing, was so big that nobody knew how to build a dome that wouldn't be so heavy it would collapse. After lots of mathematical calculations, Brunelleschi decided to build a dome with a slight point, rather than a smooth, round top. This style, called ogival, helped reduce the pressure of the structure and made the base of the dome responsible for supporting its weight, which made it stronger.h

Despite concerted efforts, many communities lack the funds to fully address these issues, and often seek funds elsewhere. Numerous watersheds within Los Angeles County, California do not meet state water quality standards, despite spending $100 million a year on clean water programs to combat issues such as urban runoff. To combat this problem, officials have introduced a measure that would assess a fee to homeowners and local businesses in attempt to raise $290 million for effective urban runoff management. Section::::Prevention and mitigation. Effective control of urban runoff involves reducing the velocity and flow of stormwater, as well as reducing pollutant discharges. A variety of stormwater management practices and systems may be used to reduce the effects of urban runoff. Some of these techniques (called best management practices (BMPs) in the US), focus on water quantity control, while others focus on improving water quality, and some perform both functions. /div Pollution prevention practices include low impact development (LID) or green infrastructure techniques - known as Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) in the UK, and Water-Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) in Australia and the Middle East - such as the installation of green roofs and improved chemical handling (e.g. management of motor fuels &amp; oil, fertilizers and pesticides).h	"ø+What practices could I use at home to help?"IWhat practices could I use at home to reduce the effects of urban runoff?2DWhat best management practices could I use at home to reduce runoff?BMARCO_D3140149bÍ	You can use it to store stormwater and/or allow stormwater to infiltrate into the soil.

Some cities offer financial incentives for using rainwater for irrigation as a supplement to municipal water. Caution Check for restrictions on rain barrels and rain harvesting in your area. You may need a permit in some locations, or the use of rain barrels may be prohibited or governed by state, local or neighborhood regulations. Rain Barrel Considerations Plan to install the barrel at a downspout near where you need the water. A rain barrel supplies low-pressure water, and the flow rate decreases as the barrel empties. Elevating the barrel improves the flow rate, and some barrels come with a pump to increase water pressure. The increased flow can supply low-pressure drip irrigation, but sprinklers and hose-end sprayers do not work with a rain barrel. Your other alternatives for dispensing the water are a garden hose, soaker hose or watering can. Estimate how much rainwater you'll capture. Collection rates vary depending on the slope and size of the roof, but for estimation purposes, during a 1-inch rainfall you can collect a little over half a gallon for each square foot of roof.h"≤

How much rain water can I catch? The Puget Sound averages about three feet of rain per year, but two thirds of it falls from November to March. Most areas in the region average less than two inches total rainfall for July and August. To determine the amount of rain your roof catches, multiply your home‚Äôs width by its length (in feet) to estimate its footprint. Then estimate the portion of this area that drains to the downspout you‚Äôll be using to catch your rain. This formula will give a rough estimate of how much rain you can catch: Rain caught (gallons) = (inches of rain) x 0.6* x (portion of building footprint). *One inch of rain falling on a square foot of surface yields approximately 0.6 gallons of water. For example, if your home‚Äôs footprint is 1,400 square feet, and you want to know the amount of water that comes from a ¬º inch (.25‚Äù) rain event: Rain caught (gallons) = (.25) x (.6) x (1,400) = 210 gallons (or less if you‚Äôre only gathering from one part of the roof).h"⁄èThat sounds like a lot of water.

The effect is that you keep drinking to get more dopamine release, but at the same time you‚Äôre altering other brain chemicals that are enhancing feelings of depression. Research suggests that alcohol‚Äôs affect on dopamine is more significant for men than women, which may account for men drinking more than women on average. According to results from the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), alcoholism affects men more than women: About 10 percent of men, compared to 3 to 5 percent of women, become alcoholics over the course of their lifetime. Over time, with more drinking, the dopamine effect diminishes until it‚Äôs almost nonexistent. But at this stage, a drinker is often ‚Äúhooked‚Äù on the feeling of dopamine release in the reward center, even though they‚Äôre no longer getting it.h"ı	What are the causes of it?"=What are the causes of dopamine release in the reward center?2"What are the causes of alcoholism?BMARCO_D1970315bﬂThis creates further withdrawal, leading to a physical dependency -- the addict needs to use more of the substance just to feel normal, creating a vicious cycle that can be difficult to break. Because of this learning process and eventual physical dependence on a substance, the substance user becomes a substance abuser. As a result, the abuser loses control over the act of taking a substance or engaging in an activity. This has led to the idea that in order to cure an addiction, abstinence -- total discontinuation of substance use or behavior -- is necessary. Under the disease model of addiction, the brain's motivational center becomes reorganized. The priorities are shuffled so that finding and using the substance (or another substance that will produce similar effects) becomes top priority as far as the brain is concerned. In this sense, the drug has essentially taken over the brain, and the addict is no longer in control of his behavior. An alcoholic won't, for example, have trouble deciding whether or not to get in his car and drive to the store to get more alcohol -- the urge will be irresistible.h"è

The new report, published Thursday in the Lancet and boasting 120 co-authors, aggregated data from multiple studies of drinking patterns and health outcomes among nearly 600,000 people in 19 high-income countries. Strikingly, the data did not show a significant difference between men and women in the amount of alcohol that can be consumed without a drop in life expectancy.

Instead, a little bit too much causes a little lower life expectancy. But as the drinker ventures further beyond the threshold, the life expectancy continues to erode in dramatic fashion. Wood and her colleagues found that the threshold for health risks is 100 grams per week (about the alcohol in seven standard American beers, though craft beers have higher alcohol content). The drop in life expectancy for a 40-year-old who drinks between 100 and 200 grams is six months, on average, compared with someone who drinks between zero and 100 grams, the study found.h

The outdoor compressor runs in the summer to cool and in the winter to heat. The Short Story Let me contrast a heat pump with a regular AC using electric strip heat. A heat pump will save you 50% in the heating mode, but it will lose 10% when cooling. For the Brazos Valley, what you lose in the summer will not be recovered in the winter. Numerous AC researchers and managers of utilities‚Äîwith the exception of one man‚Äîhave agreed in their conversations with me: A heat pump, in our community, is not cost effective. There is no utility savings, and it can be very expensive to repair.

The investment could pay for itself on the heating costs alone ‚Äì and your air conditioning would be free! Our local Washington utilities offer rebates for heat pumps because of the real energy savings they provide. The heat pump is also one of the ‚Äògreenest‚Äô ways to heat and cool your home because it is powered off of renewable electricity. But don‚Äôt count air conditioners out just yet! The largest advantage is an air conditioner will give you a cool, comfortable home in the summer with less upfront cost than a heat pump. If you already have an energy efficient way to heat your home, such as a high efficiency gas furnace, then perhaps a heat pump will not yield a high enough return on investment. Or, if space is an issue then an air conditioner may be the right choice as they are more compact and fit into tighter spaces.h"çAWhat are the pros and cons between a gas furnace and a heat pump?"AWhat are the pros and cons between a gas furnace and a heat pump?2AWhat are the pros and cons between a gas furnace and a heat pump?BMARCO_D3003774b≠	Most of the heat pumps are convenient to use, and take up very little space. Heat pumps come with a promise of long term service, and are also cheaper when compared to other heating devices. Certain heat pumps are eco-friendly too. In order to use a furnace in your household, you need certain components, like a thermostat, blowers and burners. One of the plus points of a furnace is that it can provide heat by burning various sources, like gas, oil, wood, electricity and coal. Moreover, the blowers and burners make sure that the furnace works for a longer time. Current age thermostats are now digitalized, and hence, you can now control the temperatures of your household efficiently; thereby reducing your electricity bills and fuel costs. In summary, heat pumps prove to be a better choice when compared to furnaces. The following are the major differences between a heat pump and a furnace:1. A heat pump can either increase or lower temperatures, however a furnace can only provide heat.2. Even though one might opt for a furnace, purchasing a heat pump might be necessary if the temperatures are soaring high.3. The sources used by heat pumps are limited, and are somewhat eco-friendly.h"Ì

In fact, with the relatively warm ground temperatures around Houston, Ft. Bend, and Brazoria, geothermal may seem like the ideal heating and cooling system. As great as geothermal can be, though, there are times when a conventional air-source heat pump is preferable. Both geothermal and air-source heat pumps are more energy efficient than gas and oil furnaces. Beyond this, there are a number of important differences between these two types of heat pumps. Energy efficiency ‚Äì Geothermal heat pump systems are more energy efficient. These heat pumps operate at between 300 to 600 percent efficiency even in the coldest weather. Air-source heat pumps, on the other hand, reach 175 to 300 percent efficiency even in milder winter weather. Upfront costs ‚Äì Geothermal systems have higher purchase and installation costs. Lower energy costs let you recoup this investment over time, but if you‚Äôre planning to move soon, a less expensive air-source heat pump may be the wiser choice."ó

A study by the Air Force Institute of Technology calculated that it takes on average just seven to eight years to recoup costs. Your actual break-even point depends on local utility rates, excavation/drilling costs, how well your house is insulated, the efficiency of the model you choose, and what incentives your state or utilities provide. A good installer who's knowledgeable about heating and cooling as well as your local geology will be able to make those calculations for you. The current federal incentive is limited to the standard $300 tax credit for Energy Star HVAC installations. (Canadians retrofitting an existing home with geothermal qualify for a $3,500 federal grant.) Some forward-thinking utilities have offered low-interest loans to homeowners willing to adopt the technology. ""It's a win-win arrangement,"" says Steve Rosenstock, energy solutions manager at the Edison Electric Institute, an association of utilities.h"ÿ	+That‚Äôs great.

What makes a geothermal heat pump so efficient?BMARCO_D3052924b£It does this through long loops of underground pipes filled with liquid (water or an antifreeze solution). The loops are hooked up to a geothermal heat pump in your home, which acts as both a furnace and an air conditioner. During the heating season, the liquid pulls heat from the ground and delivers it to the geothermal heating and cooling unit and then to refrigerant coils, where the heat is distributed through a forced-air or hydronic system. During the cooling season, the process runs in reverse. The pump removes heat from your house and transfers it to the earth. Many units can provide domestic hot water as well. A geothermal heat pump is vastly more efficient than conventional heating systems because it doesn‚Äôt burn fuel to create warmth; it simply moves existing heat from one place to another. And because temperatures underground remain a relatively constant 50 degrees F year round, the system requires a lot less energy to cool your home than conventional AC systems or air-source heat pumps, which use outside air as a transfer medium.h"ıICool science.

BULLET::::- An Auxiliary Heat/Emergency Heat system, for example a traditional furnace, is also important if the heat pump is malfunctioning or being repaired. In colder climates, split-system heat pumps matched with gas, oil or pellet fuel furnaces will work even in extremely cold temperatures. Section::::Controversy. Units charged with HFC refrigerants are often marketed as low energy or a sustainable technology, however if the HFC leaks out from the system, there is potential to contribute to global warming, as measured in global warming potential (GWP) and ozone depletion potential (ODP). Recent government mandates have seen the phase-out of R-22 refrigerant and its replacement with more environmentally sound R-410A refrigerant. Section::::Impact on electric utilities. While heat pumps with backup systems other than electrical resistance heating are often encouraged by electric utilities, air source heat pumps are a concern for winter-peaking utilities if electrical resistance heating is used as the supplemental or replacement heat source when the temperature drops below the point that the heat pump can meet all of the home's heat requirement.h"ô		Tell me about AC systems."Tell me about AC systems.2Tell me about AC systems.BMARCO_D3352767b±An AC system has many components: compressor, condenser, receiver dryer, evaporator, and hoses. The compressor, the ‚Äúheart‚Äù of the car‚Äôs air conditioning system works like a pump taking refrigerant, (R-12 in older cars, R-134a in 1995 and newer cars) and pressurizing it, passing it along to the evaporator. The AC compressor has several moving parts (including pistons and valves). These internal parts can fail, causing the AC compressor to stop working. It is common for the internal parts of the compressor to come apart and disperse metallic debris throughout the system. Consequently, it is a requirement to replace the orifice tube and the receiver dryer when replacing the compressor since some of the debris may have ended up there. For an AC compressor to work, it needs a clutch, bearing, and an electrical connector. The clutch is driven by a drive/serpentine belt, which engages the compressor when you switch on the AC. The clutch can burn or the bearing can fail. If the bearing or clutch have failed, it is recommended that the compressor be replaced.h"∏

%How is it different from a heat pump?"3How is an AC compressor different from a heat pump?2/How is an AC system different from a heat pump?BMARCO_D981398bï	How They Work While heat pumps and conventional air conditioners differ, they rely on the same principals to condition inside air temperatures. Both systems utilize a compressor to compress refrigerant contained within the system. Inside the compressor, gas is compressed, causing its temperature to rise significantly. The gas then flows through the condensing coil where it cools to ambient temperature. As the gas enters the evaporator coil‚Äîlocated inside the house‚Äîit expands, causing its temperature to rapidly drop and cool the evaporator coil. A fan or blower assembly within the air handler draws air through the cooled evaporator coil to provide conditioned air to the home‚Äôs interior. The main difference between the two systems is that a heat pump can reverse the process by switching the function of the evaporator and condenser coils to raise inside temperatures. Choosing the Best Option Choosing between a conventional central ac system and a heat pump depends on several factors with the most notable being your climate. Areas of the country subjected to temperatures 40-degrees and lower for extended periods are not ideal for heat pump installation.h

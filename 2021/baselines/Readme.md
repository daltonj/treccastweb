## Baseline run description

The baseline system is a three-step retrieval process where, given a query, (1) the top-n documents are retrieved from the index and (2) chunked into passages using Spacy's SentenceRecognizer pipeline. (3) Passages are then re-ranked using a neural re-ranker.

For (1), we use a simple BM25 function (K1=4.46, b=0.82), and for (3), we use a [T5 re-ranker](https://aclanthology.org/2020.findings-emnlp.63/) trained on the MS MARCO passage dataset.

`org_automatic_results_1000.v1.0.run` is the results file generated by retrieving and re-ranking the passages from the top 1000 documents using the automatic rewrites. 

`org_manual_results_1000.v1.0.run` is the results file generated by retrieving and re-ranking the passages from the top 1000 documents using the manual rewrites.

We also provide the converted versions of each run after they have been converted from passage to document ids and deduped (`document_runs`).

<!-- Note: We also provide the source BM25 document runs used in the passage ranking. These are not submittable runs, but the candidate documents used when identifying source passages.

`org_automatic_results_docs_1000.v1.0.run` is the candidate file generated by retrieving the top 1000 documents with BM25 using the automatic rewrites.

`org_manual_results_docs_1000.v1.0.run` is the candidate file generated by retrieving the top 1000 documents with BM25 using the manual rewrites. -->

## Baseline Rewriter Policy

We use the [T5 model trained on the CANARD dataset](https://huggingface.co/castorini/t5-base-canard) to generate our baseline automatic rewrites.

For a given query `n` in a topic, the rewrite context consists of all queries from previous turns (turn `1` to turn `n-1`) and the passages from the last three turns (turn `n-3` to turn `n-1`).

For example, the automatic rewrite for topic `107`, turn `8` (identified as `107-8`) was generated by passing the following as context:

`query 107-1 ||| query 107-2 ||| query 107-3 ||| query 107-4 ||| query 107-5 ||| passage 107-5 ||| query 107-6 ||| passage 107-6 ||| query 107-7 ||| passage 107-7`

Third, melting ice caps, ice sheets and glaciers, as well as expanding warming waters, will lead to rising sea levels. Rising sea levels could push saltwater into freshwater aquifers, making the water unusable for drinking or irrigation.

In 2015, the Obama administration committed to reducing U.S. emissions by 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2025. The beating heart of the Paris agreement is its requirement that countries ratchet up their ambition every five years. And even though the rollbacks of the Trump administration mean the United States will now miss this target, Biden has committed to quickly put the country on an even steeper trajectory of cuts by 2030, en route to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. The new 2030 target will be an early signal of where the rubber hits the road internationally for the Biden administration.",

This is based on an assessment of the Biden campaign’s clean energy and climate package, including his commitment to decarbonize the U.S. energy system by 2035 — the biggest element of the package by far. While this will not be enough to immediately align the United States with the Paris agreement’s goal of limiting global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius, it would represent a huge first restorative step within a relatively short period.

It is also an excellent facial moisturizer, and if you decide to use it on your face, keep in mind that very little olive oil is needed.

Simply place the shea butter and the cocoa butter in a glass bowl and microwave for about 30 seconds until melted. Stir in the arrowroot powder and baking soda, then add the oils and stir again. Use a small measuring cup or small ladle to pour into a deodorant tube. Note that this recipe will almost overfill one tube, so be careful!

A homemade body scrub helps moisturize and exfoliate the skin, and with cold weather approaching it will make a killer gift this winter. It is simple to make and you can experiment with different sugars, Epsom salt, a variety of carrier oils, and essential oils. Feel free to get creative and fancy when making these scrubs; here is the basic recipe you can use to make a few batches. You’ll need 2 cups Epsom salts or sugar (use organic cane sugar, brown sugar, or regular granulated), 1 cup carrier oil (grapeseed, olive, sweet almond, sesame, and safflower are all good), and 8-10 drops of your favourite essential oil. First, add Epsom salts or sugar to a bowl and slowly begin stirring in the oil until the mixture is smooth, but not goopy (You may not need the full cup of oil). Then, add essential oil and any other fun additions and mix well. Spoon into a decorative container or glass jar with a tight-fitting lid. You should choose sugar for fine grain homemade body scrub, and Epsom salts for a larger grain scrub. The oil will separate in some of these scrubs, so it’s a good idea to attach a small spoon if giving away as a gift.",

Half Marathon Training with Weight Lifting You need at least two weight training sessions per week. Here is a list of great strength training exercises for runners. Compound workouts such as Trap Bar and Squats and single-leg workouts such as lunges are great ways to work out multiple muscle groups at the same time. The lunge matrix is a great strength training exercise that can be done with or without weights. To start, your body’s weight is sufficient enough as a great starting point for the lunge matrix. Take complete rest for at least 45 seconds up to 3 minutes between sets. Strength training needs a longer rest period because it is more exhausting and demanding on your overall body.",

A high-quality workout lasting longer and at a higher intensity is better for increasing your performance. Scientific studies on professional athletes have shown that very positive effects can be achieved by specific workouts with previously emptied glycogen stores. This causes your body to optimize and economize its fat metabolism. The body learns to make do longer with the glycogen stored in the muscles. However, there is no substantial evidence showing that this leads to improved race performance. At the same time, it is important to note that regular training with previously emptied glycogen stores can adversely affect your health.",

The intensity should be at 200 watts or greater. 2. Cross-country skiing: Approximately 850 calories per hour. This all depends on your experience as a skier.

Although jumping rope makes significantly less noise than tap dancing or playing loud music with your sound system speakers on the floor, it can create a slight disturbance. Even the muffled thud of your feet jumping steadily in your sneakers or other sports training shoes can become a nuisance to other apartment dwellers living below you. For this reason, you may need to invest in a mat or even some soundproofing installation for your floor. Some people jump rope on thin, closely woven carpeting, although jumping on carpets is not usually recommended. Wood flooring is really the best to jump rope on, but you need to make sure your jumping does not disturb your neighbours before starting your regular jumping routine at home. If you happen to have concrete floor tiling in your apartment, you should find another space for exercising since jumping rope on a concrete surface can cause pain and injury to your knees. If you must jump on such hard flooring sometimes, be sure to use a good jump rope mat to absorb most of the impact of your jumping.",

These undercover individuals broke into several Democratic offices within the Watergate and installed wire taps and recording equipment. Unfortunately for Nixon, the equipment was installed haphazardly and had to be readjusted. As the intruders attempted to return to Watergate and resolve the problem, they were arrested. The White House immediately attempted to downplay the break-in, but behind the scenes, Nixon and his secret team were quickly using funds to pay for the silence and cooperation of the intruders. Nixon also made sure that the FBI remained out of the incident by forcing the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to persuade the intelligence community that the break-in was classified as a matter of national security. The Nation Reacts While Nixon thought he was able to successfully cover up the break-in at the Watergate complex, members of the press, Congress and legal experts began questioning the event.

John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, was convicted of engaging in illegal activities by federal prosecutors. When that information became public, Judge Sirica increased the pressure on the Watergate intruders. In March, Sirica finally achieved his desired outcome when one of the intruders released information linking CREEP to the break-in. The dominoes were now falling one by one. In May, another convicted intruder testified before the Watergate Committee and revealed additional information linking not only CREEP, but the Nixon Administration to the events at Watergate. Eventually, the Watergate Committee called on John Dean, who was Nixon's lead legal counsel, who testified to Nixon's involvement in the break-in and cover-up.

Howard Simons was the managing editor of the \"Post\" during Watergate and he dubbed the secret informant \"Deep Throat\", alluding to both the deep background status of his information and the widely publicized 1972 pornographic film \"Deep Throat\". For more than 30 years, Deep Throat's identity was one of the biggest mysteries of American politics and journalism and the source of much public curiosity and speculation.",

If (3) is true, then we almost certainly live in a simulation. In the dark forest of our current ignorance, it seems sensible to apportion one's credence roughly evenly between (1), (2), and (3)... I note that people who hear about the simulation argument often react by saying, 'Yes, I accept the argument, and it is obvious that it is possibility # n that obtains.' But different people pick a different n. Some think it obvious that (1) is true, others that (2) is true, yet others that (3) is true.\" As a corollary to the trilemma, Bostrom states that \"Unless we are now living in a simulation, our descendants will almost certainly never run an ancestor-simulation.\"",

Do not let disdain or contempt show in your tone! Always treat their problems and fears with importance. Never shun off your teenager’s fears as a childhood worry. 2. Praise Often: You must praise your teenager often. Be generous with your compliments. When you praise your teenager for something good they did, it boosts their confidence in heaps and bounds. It encourages them to do even better next time. Always express yourself and let them know how good and proud you feel to have them as your kid. 3. Avoid Criticism: Try and avoid criticising as much as you can. Criticism can be detrimental for your teenager’s self-confidence. If you disapprove or dislike something that involves your teen, take time to sit with them and talk it out.",

Armstrong shook his head and laughed off the distractions, keeping his composure. The session ended around 6 am, going longer than expected. To make sure the orchestra members were paid extra for their overtime, Armstrong accepted only $250 musicians union scale for his work.",

When Pops (who adored Thiele and Weiss’ masterwork) passed away on July 6, 1971, “What a Wonderful World” seemed destined for stateside obscurity. Then along came a bare-knuckled comedy called Good Morning, Vietnam (1987).

The city-state was also a center of slave trade. where slaves were exchanged for European goods. The main ethnic group took out of Calabar as slaves were the Igbo, although they were not the most populous ethnicity in the area. Most slave ships that transported slaves from Calabar were English; around 85% of these ships were from Bristol and Liverpool merchants. Conditions were brutal. In 1767, six British slaving vessels were lying in the Calabar river at a time when the people of Duke Town and Old Town were feuding. By prearrangement with the leaders of Duke Town, the leaders of Old Town were invited on board for a conference to settle the dispute, with guarantees of their safety. They were seized, with some kept as slaves and a few handed over to Duke Town, where they were executed.",

Nigerians say the grains in Ghanian Jollof rice are too starchy. Nigerians are a bit forward and loud in their debate. On social media, they use a lot of videos, memes, gifs and pictures to throw a lot of shade on Ghanaian Jollof. Sometime in 2016, they even tried to get Facebook owner Mark Zuckerberg to decide which Jollof tastes better. Hilarious! The Ghanaians are more on the defensive, trying to block and counteract the attack from Nigerians on social media. You won’t blame them. With the ferocity of attack they get from Nigerians on social media, it’s pretty easy to think Nigerian Jollof rice tastes better. Both dishes taste great, however, and it will be unfair to rate a dish above the other. Why? Both dishes are unique and they can’t or shouldn’t be compared.

A second difference is the method of cooking. The grains used in Nigerian Jollof have to be parboiled and washed a second time to remove the starchy content. Party Jollof rice is a popular trademark in most Nigerian parties and celebrations. This dish is legendary for its smoky taste. This dish is cooked over firewood and allowed to burn at the bottom to give it a smoky flavor. A significant spice used in cooking the Nigerian Jollof is the bay leaf, which also adds to its rich smoky flavor. Ghanian Jollof is made with basmati rice which is also known as Thai Jasmine rice. Basmati is a long slender grained rice with a higher starch content than the long grain parboiled rice. Basmati also has a characteristic aromatic smell. Like the long grain rice, basmati is not native to Ghana but imported from Asian countries, especially India. The basmati rice is not parboiled. Parboiling makes it soggy.  To prevent this, Ghanaians prepare the tomato stew and meat stock and use that to cook the rice at once. Ghanian Jollof rice is also spicier than Nigerian Jollof. While Nigerians use bay leaf as a key spice, Ghanaians use shito, an oily condiment made with hot peppers, ginger, shrimps and onion.

The Wolof people were also called the Djolof or Jolof tribe. It is believed that Jollof was invented by a woman who lived near the Senegal river delta. It is said that this woman substituted rice for barley during a barley shortage. Using rice, fish, vegetables and tomatoes she created a tasty dish which was called Jollof. The Senegalese also have another name for this dish, Thieboudienne. In Gambia, it is called Benachim (One pot). The Jollof recipe travelled from Senegal to the Gambia, Mauritania then to other West African countries. The Ghanaians and Nigerians mastered the recipe, became experts and are struggling for copyrights. A poll done in 2013 revealed that 40% thought Jollof originated from Ghana, 21% thought it originated from Nigeria, while 23% thought Jollof originated from Senegal.",

In a pyramid scheme, those who recruit additional participants benefit directly. Failure to recruit typically means no investment return. A Ponzi scheme claims to rely on some esoteric investment approach, and often attracts well-to-do investors, whereas pyramid schemes explicitly claim that new money will be the source of payout for the initial investments. A pyramid scheme typically collapses much faster because it requires exponential increases in participants to sustain it.

Bubbles are often said to be based on the \"greater fool\" theory. As with the Ponzi scheme, the price exceeds the intrinsic value of the item, but unlike the Ponzi scheme: In most economic bubbles, there is no single person or group misrepresenting the intrinsic value. A common exception is a pump and dump scheme (typically involving buyers and holders of thinly-traded stocks), which has much more in common with a Ponzi scheme compared to other types of bubbles.

                "response": "Buenos Aires is a grandiose city with wide avenues and a vibrant cosmopolitan flair that is more generally European than Latin American in character. Having little colonial architecture and few landmark buildings, Buenos Aires is chiefly a city of distinctive neighbourhoods that have their own meeting places, generally coffeehouses or bars. This is a tradition rooted in the colonial period when the centre of each neighbourhood was a general store and bar known as a pulpería. The energy and bustle of modern Buenos Aires is most evident in the city centre—the locus of entertainment, shopping, and café-going. Porteños relish politics, football (soccer), and the city’s cultural offerings. At night Buenos Aires’s boites (nightclubs) swell with revellers dancing the tango, the emotional dance that originated in the lower-class areas of the city and that is said to reflect the essence of the soul of the porteño.",

The most popular type of pastry is said to be that of medialunas (singular: medialuna, literally half-moon, that is to say, crescent), based upon French croissants. Furthermore, sandwiches de miga are another type of bread product; they are made only with thin layers of white bread (generally referred to as crustless bread) and stuffed with food items ranging from ham and cheese to other more sophisticated combinations such as raw ham, tomatoes, olives, hard-boiled eggs, tuna, lettuce, red pepper, and the like. Desserts and sweets are usually stuffed or covered with dulce de leche. The latter can be eaten alone or on top of cakes, alfajores, panqueques ( crepes ), and pastries, or as a topping spread over flan de leche.

Moreover, to prevent liquid Hydrogen from boiling off, the rockets need insulation from all heat sources, such as rocket engine exhaust, air friction during launch, and radiant heat from the sun. Hydrogen rockets need advanced metallurgy to prevent hydrogen embrittlement. Metals become brittle when exposed to the extreme cold of liquid Hydrogen. It also leaks very easily. Liquid Hydrogen can leak through tiny pores in welded joints. Liquid Hydrogen is costly too. An enormous amount of technical expertise is necessary to solve all these problems.

The electric is the simplest of these being powered by a battery, but these can be heavy and are only recently becoming possible.

For example, degraded reefs are less productive and may not be able to sustain accretion rates necessary to ensure reefs continue to provide shoreline protection services. Reefs damaged by coral bleaching can quickly lose many of the features that underpin the aesthetic appeal that is fundamental to reef tourism. The resultant loss of revenue from reduced tourist activity can threaten the livelihoods of local communities. Coral bleaching events that lead to significant coral mortality can drive large shifts in fish communities. This can translate into reduced catches for fishers targeting reef fish species, which in turn leads to impacts on food supply and associated economic activities. Cultural values of many tropical island communities (e.g., religious sites and traditional uses of marine resources) depend upon healthy coral reef ecosystems and can be adversely affected by coral bleaching.

Carbon capture and storage When growing their skeletons, corals use carbon that is found as either dissolved inorganic carbon or particulate organic carbon in the surrounding waters. As they get larger, corals grow in a tree-like fashion, forming growth rings. Coral reefs are important in determining the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The zooxanthellae algae, through photosynthesis, remove carbon dioxide from the air and make carbohydrates available as food for both the zooxanthellae and the coral polyps.",

Everyone is different so you will need to find a comfortable balance that suits you. Handlebar position Well-positioned handlebars are crucial for your comfort and important for control of your steering and brakes. Handlebars vary in how they can be adjusted. A good position to start is with your handlebars at the same height as your saddle. If you prefer a more aerodynamic ‘head down’ position, lower the bars.",

A major concern for both men and women is too much pressure that can affect the flow of blood to the genitals. This means that the design of a seat is important. However, there are unisex seats in the market which can be used by both women and men. These seats are widely used in most fashions of bicycles, especially those for hire or intended for use for a short period of time. Also, taller women tend to fit on men’s bike seats and shorter men often prefer women’s seats as their posture on the bicycle tends to be similar. Women ride differently from men. So if you are looking for a seat that you intend to use for a considerable period of time, it is advisable that you look for a gender-sensitive one that fits to avoid injury to your pelvic area and bones.",

Cap did say it at the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron when he and Black Widow put together a new Avengers team, but Joss Whedon's film cheekily cut off the second half of the phrase. In Infinity War, Rogers had spent two years as a fugitive, and the heroes who joined King T'Challa's army defending Wakanda couldn't be really considered a true Avengers team. But in Endgame, Captain America had the authority to make the call and by declaring every hero standing with him an Avenger, he unified the gigantic fighting force to the singular cause of beating Thanos once and for all. Cap making everyone fighting Thanos an Avenger in Endgame is a spiritual successor to Clint Barton's speech to Wanda Maximoff at the Battle of Sokovia in Age of Ultron. Terrified for her life, Hawkeye motivated Scarlet Witch to find her courage and fight, telling her, \"If you walk out that door, you are an Avenger.\" In Endgame, everyone who walked through a magic portal and joined the superheroes who travelled through time to resurrect them was an Avenger by Captain America's decree. The moment is so rousing and iconic, Cap's words also brought the audience into the fight so that every fan who felt uplifted could also imagine themselves as Avengers.",

Steve was torn out of his own time and his hopes for a life with Peggy into the present day where he was a fish out of water fighting aliens as the ideal of \"Captain America\".

In my opinion, if we want real change in terms of minority representation in comics and comic book creators, there’s going to need to be a perfect storm of the right creator, the right characters, organic change, and a great marketing campaign with a definitive push for comics to reach new markets who, maybe, didn’t feel fully included in the past.”",

Algorithms may seem like “objectively” mathematic processes, but this is far from the truth. Racial bias seeps into algorithms in several subtle and not-so-subtle ways, leading to discriminatory results and outcomes. Let’s take a deeper look. The danger of automation Algorithms can get the results you want for the wrong reasons. By automating an algorithm, it often finds patterns that you could not have predicted. The legend of the neural net tank experiment demonstrates this limitation of algorithms. ​ ​ Automation poses dangers when data is imperfect, messy, or biased. An algorithm might latch onto unimportant data and reinforce unintentional implicit biases. For example, data scientist Daphne Koller explained that an algorithm designed to recognize fractures from X-rays ended up instead recognizing which hospital generated the image. That algorithm now incorporates irrelevant data and skews results.​ ​ Imagine if an algorithm is exposed to racially biased data sets: it will continue to incorporate those biases, even in a completely different context. By training an algorithm on that dataset, it learned to automatically filter out any “black-sounding” names. The algorithm selected candidates on purely subjective criteria, perpetuating racial discrimination. This same form of automated discrimination prevents people of color from getting access to employment, housing, even student loans. Automation means we will create blind spots and racist biases in our so-called objective algorithms.",

What does ‘preparation work’ includes? Three main stages.

The search engine market is very one sided with just a couple companies controlling the entire market. “ Search neutrality is a principle that search engines should have no editorial policies other than that their results be comprehensive, impartial and based solely on relevance. This means that when a user queries a search engine, the engine should return the most relevant results found in the provider’s domain (those sites which the engine has knowledge of), without manipulating the order of the results (except to rank them by relevance), excluding results, or in any other way manipulating the results to a certain bias .”",

Meet a Google Alternative That Plants Trees Ecosia Ecosia is a not-for-profit search engine that uses advertising revenue gained from searches to plant trees. It doesn’t have the privacy-focus of DuckDuckGo, nor does it have the search results of Google. But it does have a unique mission. This search engine is getting bigger and more widely recognized. For example, starting with Apple’s iOS 14 and iPadOS 14, Ecosia is one of the few options you can use as your default search engine in Safari. Google Chrome also includes it as a built-in option.

While Google is a globally recognized search engine and an industry giant, in fact, even the second biggest “search engine” is Google Images, according to this study: Search engine market share Even if it’s the biggest and most well known, it doesn’t mean it’s your only choice. One of the main reasons that people choose to use an alternative search engine instead is for increased privacy, as Google is known to track user data both for its own and third-party use. If you’ve only ever used Google, check out some of the other search engines and you might find something that you prefer. Bing Bing search engine Microsoft’s Bing is the second largest search engine after Google. It’s easy to use and provides a more visual experience with beautiful daily background photos. Bing is great for video searches, as it displays results as large thumbnails that can be previewed with sound by hovering over them. DuckDuckGo is a popular search engine for those who value their privacy and are put off by the thought of their every query being tracked and logged.It has a very clean interface with minimal ads and infinite scrolling, so the user experience is nice and streamlined. There’s absolutely zero user tracking, and you can even add DuckDuckGo’s extension to your browser to keep your activity private.",

First, pollution from burning fossil fuels is bad enough for the air we breathe, but many impacts of climate change also impact air quality. Second, as our climate becomes warmer, some insects will see their geographic ranges grow – bringing the Lyme disease and West Nile or Zika viruses they carry along with them to new regions. Third, melting ice caps, ice sheets and glaciers, as well as expanding warming waters, will lead to rising sea levels. Rising sea levels could push saltwater into freshwater aquifers, making the water unusable for drinking or irrigation. Finally, water pollution can have a multitude of negative effects on the environment, some of which can lead to even more problems.",

As important as this will be, a more significant demonstration of Biden’s determination to rejoin the international fight against climate change will come in the form of the target the United States then puts on the table as its contribution toward meeting the goals of the agreement. In 2015, the Obama administration committed to reducing U.S. emissions by 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2025. The beating heart of the Paris agreement is its requirement that countries ratchet up their ambition every five years. And even though the rollbacks of the Trump administration mean the United States will now miss this target, Biden has committed to quickly put the country on an even steeper trajectory of cuts by 2030, en route to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. The new 2030 target will be an early signal of where the rubber hits the road internationally for the Biden administration.",

                "response": "And, along with the administration’s willingness to use trade policy as a lever for climate action, it will be a key arrow in the United States’ diplomatic quiver for rallying other major emitters to increase their own targets. Analysis by the Asia Society Policy Institute and Climate Analytics shows that this target is likely to be somewhere between a 38 to 54 per cent cut in emissions below 2005 levels by 2030. This is based on an assessment of the Biden campaign’s clean energy and climate package, including his commitment to decarbonize the U.S. energy system by 2035 — the biggest element of the package by far. While this will not be enough to immediately align the United States with the Paris agreement’s goal of limiting global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius, it would represent a huge first restorative step within a relatively short period. Importantly, given uncertainties about the makeup of the Senate, the report also finds that around half of Biden’s plans could be achieved without the need for congressional support.",

First, add Epsom salts or sugar to a bowl and slowly begin stirring in the oil until the mixture is smooth, but not goopy (You may not need the full cup of oil). Then, add essential oil and any other fun additions and mix well. Spoon into a decorative container or glass jar with a tight-fitting lid. You should choose sugar for fine grain homemade body scrub, and Epsom salts for a larger grain scrub.

For example, the iPhone 6 Plus averages about a day and a half of usage, even on heavier days. So if you find yourself struggling to make it a full day with your current phone, you might want to consider going up a size. Bigger phones are also better suited for consumption. Sure, most people still use smartphones to communicate, but fewer people are placing calls than a decade ago. Text-based communication, in many cases, is more convenient and timely. With larger displays and more capable processors, however, multimedia consumption has become a major part of mobile users’ daily habits. Reading the web, watching videos, playing games, and listening to music have all become a primary function of smartphones for mobile users. In many ways, a larger display is better suited for consumption. More data can be displayed at any given time on a web page or in a social feed, which means less scrolling.",

Half Marathon Training with Weight Lifting You need at least two weight training sessions per week. Here is a list of great strength training exercises for runners. Compound workouts such as Trap Bar and Squats and single-leg workouts such as lunges are great ways to work out multiple muscle groups at the same time. The lunge matrix is a great strength training exercise that can be done with or without weights. To start, your body’s weight is sufficient enough as a great starting point for the lunge matrix. Take complete rest for at least 45 seconds up to 3 minutes between sets. Strength training needs a longer rest period because it is more exhausting and demanding on your overall body.",

Here are some exercises you might want to add to your routine if you're trying to burn more calories: 1. Indoor cycling: Approximately 952 calories per hour. The intensity should be at 200 watts or greater. 2. Cross-country skiing: Approximately 850 calories per hour. This all depends on your experience as a skier.

With kickboxing, other types of martial arts like Muay Thai are valid as well.

Increase the intensity of your runs. For people with a limited time frame for working out, you might have to speed up your pace during the run in order to burn more calories. You can do a variety of different running workouts to help you get the most out of each run. 3. Eat more fruits and vegetables. Also, eat less of everything else.

Balance calories and quality Anytime you want weight loss, calorie intake should be lower than calorie burn. Just because you start running doesn’t mean you’ll automatically lose weight. It can be easy to increase your food intake as you increase your exercise. Obviously, you don’t need to do something as drastic as starving yourself; that will only cause more damage. However, if you’re not careful it can be easy to match your extra calorie burn from running with extra food intake which could slow weight loss efforts. If you’re unsure how much food to cut out, start by cutting down food intake by about 20%, and speak with a health professional for more individual guidance for weight loss.",

While it is true that running on an empty stomach, if done in the right way, can eventually force your body to increasingly obtain the energy it needs from free fatty acids, this is not the decisive factor in losing weight. The percentage of energy produced by burning fat is quite high, but the total energy expenditure (TEE) and thus calorie consumption are relatively low due to the low training intensity.",

Scientific studies on professional athletes have shown that very positive effects can be achieved by specific workouts with previously emptied glycogen stores. This causes your body to optimize and economize its fat metabolism. The body learns to make do longer with the glycogen stored in the muscles. However, there is no substantial evidence showing that this leads to improved race performance.

Here are some exercises you might want to add to your routine if you're trying to burn more calories: 1. Indoor cycling: Approximately 952 calories per hour. The intensity should be at 200 watts or greater. 2. Cross-country skiing: Approximately 850 calories per hour. This all depends on your experience as a skier. Slow, light effort won't burn nearly as many calories as a brisk-speed, vigorous effort will. To really challenge yourself and burn up energy? Try uphill skiing.",

Although jumping rope makes significantly less noise than tap dancing or playing loud music with your sound system speakers on the floor, it can create a slight disturbance. Even the muffled thud of your feet jumping steadily in your sneakers or other sports training shoes can become a nuisance to other apartment dwellers living below you. For this reason, you may need to invest in a mat or even some soundproofing installation for your floor. Some people jump rope on thin, closely woven carpeting, although jumping on carpets is not usually recommended. Wood flooring is really the best to jump rope on, but you need to make sure your jumping does not disturb your neighbours before starting your regular jumping routine at home. If you happen to have concrete floor tiling in your apartment, you should find another space for exercising since jumping rope on a concrete surface can cause pain and injury to your knees. If you must jump on such hard flooring sometimes, be sure to use a good jump rope mat to absorb most of the impact of your jumping.",

This was before the election, and the burglars were meant to acquire information on his opponents. These undercover individuals broke into several Democratic offices within the Watergate and installed wire taps and recording equipment. Unfortunately for Nixon, the equipment was installed haphazardly and had to be readjusted. As the intruders attempted to return to Watergate and resolve the problem, they were arrested. The White House immediately attempted to downplay the break-in, but behind the scenes, Nixon and his secret team were quickly using funds to pay for the silence and cooperation of the intruders. Nixon also made sure that the FBI remained out of the incident by forcing the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to persuade the intelligence community that the break-in was classified as a matter of national security. The Nation Reacts While Nixon thought he was able to successfully cover up the break-in at the Watergate complex, members of the press, Congress and legal experts began questioning the event.

John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, was convicted of engaging in illegal activities by federal prosecutors. When that information became public, Judge Sirica increased the pressure on the Watergate intruders. In March, Sirica finally achieved his desired outcome when one of the intruders released information linking CREEP to the break-in. The dominoes were now falling one by one. In May, another convicted intruder testified before the Watergate Committee and revealed additional information linking not only CREEP, but the Nixon Administration to the events at Watergate. Eventually, the Watergate Committee called on John Dean, who was Nixon's lead legal counsel, who testified to Nixon's involvement in the break-in and cover-up. Simultaneously, the one piece of evidence that Congress, as well as the federal prosecution, needed was Nixon's taped conversations in the Oval Office.",

In another outlandish move, Nixon used his executive powers to terminate Cox as a prosecutor in what became known as the ' Saturday Night Massacre .' Nixon Surrenders Nixon's intransigence and outright defiance failed to pay off. While Nixon attempted to release sanitized versions of his tapes, many had had enough. On July 24, 1974, the United States Supreme Court ruled in the case of U.S. v. Nixon that Nixon's use of executive privilege was not applicable in a criminal investigation. Within weeks of the decision, the House of Representatives approved the impeachment of Nixon on the grounds of obstruction of justice, violation of the constitution and the unlawful withholding of evidence. To make matters worse, a tape was released, known as the 'smoking gun,' which unveiled Nixon agreeing to a CIA cover-up of the Watergate break-in during a phone conversation in 1972.",

Patrick Gray, former acting Director of the FBI and Felt's boss, disputed Felt's claim in his book \"In Nixon's Web\", co-written with his son Ed Gray. Gray and others have argued that Deep Throat was a compilation of sources characterized as one person in order to improve book and movie sales.",

Other commentators, however, have speculated that Felt may have had more personal reasons for leaking information to Woodward. In his book \"The Secret Man\", Woodward describes Felt as a loyalist and admirer of J. Edgar Hoover. After Hoover's death, Felt became angry and disgusted when L. Patrick Gray, a career naval officer and lawyer from the Civil Division of the Department of Justice, with no law enforcement experience, was appointed Director of the FBI over Felt, a 30-year veteran of the FBI. Felt was particularly unhappy with Gray's management style at the FBI, which was markedly different from Hoover's. Felt selected Woodward because he knew Woodward and Bernstein were assigned to investigate the burglary.",

If (2) is true, then there must be a strong convergence among the courses of advanced civilizations so that virtually none contains any individuals who desire to run ancestor simulations and are free to do so. If (3) is true, then we almost certainly live in a simulation. In the dark forest of our current ignorance, it seems sensible to apportion one's credence roughly evenly between (1), (2), and (3)... I note that people who hear about the simulation argument often react by saying, 'Yes, I accept the argument, and it is obvious that it is possibility # n that obtains.' But different people pick a different n. Some think it obvious that (1) is true, others that (2) is true, yet others that (3) is true.\" As a corollary to the trilemma, Bostrom states that \"Unless we are now living in a simulation, our descendants will almost certainly never run an ancestor-simulation.\"",

Show Respect: Do not forget – your teenager is not a child anymore and is a near-adult, and as such, deserves respect just like any other adult. When you address your teenager, always show respect. Do not let disdain or contempt show in your tone! Always treat their problems and fears with importance. Never shun off your teenager’s fears as a childhood worry. 2. Praise Often: You must praise your teenager often. Be generous with your compliments. When you praise your teenager for something good they did, it boosts their confidence in heaps and bounds. It encourages them to do even better next time. Always express yourself and let them know how good and proud you feel to have them as your kid. 3. Avoid Criticism: Try and avoid criticising as much as you can. Criticism can be detrimental for your teenager’s self-confidence. If you disapprove or dislike something that involves your teen, take time to sit with them and talk it out.",

Look for their strengths and the things they do well, and compliment them on those. Offer them encouragement, and support, and be there to listen.

These activities build a positive team spirit in your teenager and help him learn about working together towards a common goal. 5. Support Optimistic Friendships: We know you cannot possibly control, pick and choose the kind of friends your teenager will make. Teach him about respect and acceptance. Mutual understanding and respect in any relationship are important. Teach him that value is what matters between friends. The kind of friends your teenager makes also affects his self-confidence.

City-wise, it’s got the colossal sprawl of Abuja – one of the fastest-growing urban areas in the world.

Rice made with tomatoes, onions, scotch bonnets, and chili peppers. There are endless variations on this recipe, but those five ingredients are usual constants. No list of Nigerian foods can be complete without a mention of Jollof rice.

Nigerians say the grains in Ghanian Jollof rice are too starchy. Nigerians are a bit forward and loud in their debate. On social media, they use a lot of videos, memes, gifs and pictures to throw a lot of shade on Ghanaian Jollof. Sometime in 2016, they even tried to get Facebook owner Mark Zuckerberg to decide which Jollof tastes better. Hilarious! The Ghanaians are more on the defensive, trying to block and counteract the attack from Nigerians on social media. You won’t blame them. With the ferocity of attack they get from Nigerians on social media, it’s pretty easy to think Nigerian Jollof rice tastes better. Both dishes taste great, however, and it will be unfair to rate a dish above the other. Why? Both dishes are unique and they can’t or shouldn’t be compared.

A second difference is the method of cooking. The grains used in Nigerian Jollof have to be parboiled and washed a second time to remove the starchy content. Party Jollof rice is a popular trademark in most Nigerian parties and celebrations. This dish is legendary for its smoky taste. This dish is cooked over firewood and allowed to burn at the bottom to give it a smoky flavor. A significant spice used in cooking the Nigerian Jollof is the bay leaf, which also adds to its rich smoky flavor. Ghanian Jollof is made with basmati rice which is also known as Thai Jasmine rice. Basmati is a long slender grained rice with a higher starch content than the long grain parboiled rice. Basmati also has a characteristic aromatic smell. Like the long grain rice, basmati is not native to Ghana but imported from Asian countries, especially India. The basmati rice is not parboiled. Parboiling makes it soggy.  To prevent this, Ghanaians prepare the tomato stew and meat stock and use that to cook the rice at once. Ghanian Jollof rice is also spicier than Nigerian Jollof. While Nigerians use bay leaf as a key spice, Ghanaians use shito, an oily condiment made with hot peppers, ginger, shrimps and onion.

Origins of Jollof Rice Jollof rice originates from Senegal and the Gambia where the Wolof people of that region invented the dish. No wonder Jollof sounds similar to Wolof. The Wolof people were also called the Djolof or Jolof tribe. It is believed that Jollof was invented by a woman who lived near the Senegal river delta. It is said that this woman substituted rice for barley during a barley shortage. Using rice, fish, vegetables and tomatoes she created a tasty dish which was called Jollof. The Senegalese also have another name for this dish, Thieboudienne. In Gambia, it is called Benachim (One pot). The Jollof recipe travelled from Senegal to the Gambia, Mauritania then to other West African countries. The Ghanaians and Nigerians mastered the recipe, became experts and are struggling for copyrights.

The city-state was also a center of slave trade. where slaves were exchanged for European goods. The main ethnic group took out of Calabar as slaves were the Igbo, although they were not the most populous ethnicity in the area. Most slave ships that transported slaves from Calabar were English; around 85% of these ships were from Bristol and Liverpool merchants. Conditions were brutal. In 1767, six British slaving vessels were lying in the Calabar river at a time when the people of Duke Town and Old Town were feuding. By prearrangement with the leaders of Duke Town, the leaders of Old Town were invited on board for a conference to settle the dispute, with guarantees of their safety. They were seized, with some kept as slaves and a few handed over to Duke Town, where they were executed.",

Moreover, if the operators of such a scheme are facing the likelihood of imminent collapse accompanied by criminal charges, they may see little additional \"risk\" to themselves in attempting to cover their tracks by engaging in further illegal acts to try and make good the shortfall (for example, by engaging in insider trading ).

However, several characteristics distinguish these schemes from Ponzi schemes: In a Ponzi scheme, the schemer acts as a \"hub\" for the victims, interacting with all of them directly. In a pyramid scheme, those who recruit additional participants benefit directly. Failure to recruit typically means no investment return. A Ponzi scheme claims to rely on some esoteric investment approach, and often attracts well-to-do investors, whereas pyramid schemes explicitly claim that new money will be the source of payout for the initial investments. A pyramid scheme typically collapses much faster because it requires exponential increases in participants to sustain it.

                "response": "Economic bubbles are also similar to a Ponzi scheme in that one participant gets paid by contributions from a subsequent participant until the inevitable collapse. A bubble involves ever-rising prices in an open market (for example stock, housing, cryptocurrency, tulip bulbs, or the Mississippi Company) where prices rise because buyers bid more, and buyers bid more because prices are rising. Bubbles are often said to be based on the \"greater fool\" theory. As with the Ponzi scheme, the price exceeds the intrinsic value of the item, but unlike the Ponzi scheme: In most economic bubbles, there is no single person or group misrepresenting the intrinsic value. A common exception is a pump and dump scheme (typically involving buyers and holders of thinly-traded stocks), which has much more in common with a Ponzi scheme compared to other types of bubbles. Ponzi schemes typically result in criminal charges when authorities discover them, but other than pump and dump schemes, economic bubbles do not typically involve unlawful activity or even bad faith on the part of any participant.",

Professor Nouriel Roubini of New York University has called Bitcoin the \"mother of all bubbles\". Central bankers, including former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, financial and business executives such as Warren Buffett, George Soros, Jamie Dimon, and Jack Ma have stated similar views, as well as current South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-Yeon. In 2018, there was a large sell-off of cryptocurrencies. From January to February 2018, the price of Bitcoin fell 65 percent, and by the end of the first quarter of 2018, the entire cryptocurrency market fell by 54 percent, with losses in the market topping $500 billion.",

Mate is also one of the top exports from Argentina, as it is valued all over the world. The fact that mate is so prevalent in the Southern Cone, however, should not necessarily make visitors think that other infusions are rare in the region; in Argentina especially, given the strong European cultural imprint, the consumption of coffee is very common (141 cups per capita, annually).

LH2 rocket fuel is 12 times less dense than Kerosene. Therefore, an LH2 tank would be bigger in volume for the necessary propellant than an RP-1 rocket tank. Moreover, to prevent liquid Hydrogen from boiling off, the rockets need insulation from all heat sources, such as rocket engine exhaust, air friction during launch, and radiant heat from the sun. Hydrogen rockets need advanced metallurgy to prevent hydrogen embrittlement. Metals become brittle when exposed to the extreme cold of liquid Hydrogen. It also leaks very easily. Liquid Hydrogen can leak through tiny pores in welded joints. Liquid Hydrogen is costly too. An enormous amount of technical expertise is necessary to solve all these problems. SpaceX was starting a new space program with a clean-sheet design. Because of all these problems related to LH2, SpaceX did not choose Hydrogen for their Falcon rockets.",

The electric is the simplest of these being powered by a battery, but these can be heavy and are only recently becoming possible.

LH2 rocket fuel is 12 times less dense than Kerosene. Therefore, an LH2 tank would be bigger in volume for the necessary propellant than an RP-1 rocket tank. Moreover, to prevent liquid Hydrogen from boiling off, the rockets need insulation from all heat sources, such as rocket engine exhaust, air friction during launch, and radiant heat from the sun. Hydrogen rockets need advanced metallurgy to prevent hydrogen embrittlement. Metals become brittle when exposed to the extreme cold of liquid Hydrogen. It also leaks very easily. Liquid Hydrogen can leak through tiny pores in welded joints. Liquid Hydrogen is costly too. An enormous amount of technical expertise is necessary to solve all these problems. SpaceX was starting a new space program with a clean-sheet design. Because of all these problems related to LH2, SpaceX did not choose Hydrogen for their Falcon rockets.",

The electric is the simplest of these being powered by a battery, but these can be heavy and are only recently becoming possible.

There are three things you want to achieve: The right saddle height – to make the most of your leg power and to make sure you can put a reassuring foot on the ground. Good contact with your pedals to maximise the power in your legs. Ability to reach the handlebars and your brakes – for good control and comfort. Everyone is different so you will need to find a comfortable balance that suits you. Handlebar position Well-positioned handlebars are crucial for your comfort and important for control of your steering and brakes. Handlebars vary in how they can be adjusted. A good position to start is with your handlebars at the same height as your saddle. If you prefer a more aerodynamic ‘head down’ position, lower the bars.",

A major concern for both men and women is too much pressure that can affect the flow of blood to the genitals. This means that the design of a seat is important. However, there are unisex seats in the market which can be used by both women and men. These seats are widely used in most fashions of bicycles, especially those for hire or intended for use for a short period of time. Also, taller women tend to fit on men’s bike seats and shorter men often prefer women’s seats as their posture on the bicycle tends to be similar. Women ride differently from men. So if you are looking for a seat that you intend to use for a considerable period of time, it is advisable that you look for a gender-sensitive one that fits to avoid injury to your pelvic area and bones.",

By even making remarks like these, Marvel is seemingly conceding that its target audience, its ‘core’ audience — and their ‘core’ characters — are white and male.”Little wonder that Marvel Studios, a Disney subsidiary that owns such lucrative franchises as “The Avengers,” “Ant-Man” and “Guardians of the Galaxy,” has been slower to reflect diverse characters on the big screen.",

                "response": "When asking ComicsVerse CEO, Justin Gilbert Alba, how the recent outspoken push from fans for diversity in writers and characters affected the industry. He said: “Unfortunately, the push from fans for diversity in creators and characters only represents a loud minority. All too often, comics with diverse characters and creators are cancelled due to sagging sales despite critical acclaim. In regards to Marvel particularly, I applaud their attempts to make comics mirror the people who read them. That isn’t to say there isn’t a lot more that can’t be done, there definitely is. In my opinion, if we want real change in terms of minority representation in comics and comic book creators, there’s going to need to be a perfect storm of the right creator, the right characters, organic change, and a great marketing campaign with a definitive push for comics to reach new markets who, maybe, didn’t feel fully included in the past.”",

Noble argues that search algorithms are racist and perpetuate societal problems because they reflect the negative biases that exist in society and the people who create them. Noble dismantles the idea that search engines are inherently neutral by explaining how algorithms in search engines privilege whiteness by depicting positive cues when key words like “white” are searched as opposed to “asian,” “hispanic,” or “Black.” Her main example surrounds the search results of \"Black girls\" versus \"white girls\" and the biases that are depicted in the results. These algorithms can then have negative biases against women of color and other marginalized populations, while also affecting Internet users in general by leading to \"racial and gender profiling, misrepresentation, and even economic redlining.\" The book argues that algorithms perpetuate oppression and discriminate against People of Color, specifically women of color.",

Instead, the first hit was the site HotBlackPussy.com. The first page was filled with similar results. According to Google in 2010, \"black girls\" were defined not by history, interests, or aspirations. They were defined as porn. What accounts for such racist, sexist search results? Most people tend to attribute Google failures or glitches like this to public search patterns; search engines return porn for \"black girls\" because those are the sites that people click on most.",

                "response": "When you use a search engine, relevant results are extracted from the index and ranked using an algorithm. Algorithms may seem like “objectively” mathematic processes, but this is far from the truth. Racial bias seeps into algorithms in several subtle and not-so-subtle ways, leading to discriminatory results and outcomes. Let’s take a deeper look. The danger of automation Algorithms can get the results you want for the wrong reasons. By automating an algorithm, it often finds patterns that you could not have predicted. The legend of the neural net tank experiment demonstrates this limitation of algorithms. ​ ​ Automation poses dangers when data is imperfect, messy, or biased. An algorithm might latch onto unimportant data and reinforce unintentional implicit biases. For example, data scientist Daphne Koller explained that an algorithm designed to recognize fractures from X-rays ended up instead recognizing which hospital generated the image. That algorithm now incorporates irrelevant data and skews results.​ ​ Imagine if an algorithm is exposed to racially biased data sets: it will continue to incorporate those biases, even in a completely different context. By training an algorithm on that dataset, it learned to automatically filter out any “black-sounding” names. The algorithm selected candidates on purely subjective criteria, perpetuating racial discrimination. This same form of automated discrimination prevents people of color from getting access to employment, housing, even student loans. Automation means we will create blind spots and racist biases in our so-called objective algorithms.",

It’s not an exaggeration to say that we reached a point that we depend on search engines for almost anything we do. And the reason this is happening is very simple. We know that search engines and in particular, Google has answers to all our questions and queries. What happens though when you type a query and click search? How do search engines work internally and how do they decide what to show in the search results and in what order? Watch the video tutorial to learn how do search engines work. How Do Search Engines Work Search engines are complex computer programs. Before they even allow you to type a query and search the web, they have to do a lot of preparation work so that when you click “Search”, you are presented with a set of precise and quality results that answer your question or query. What does ‘preparation work’ includes? Three main stages. The first stage is the process of discovering the information, the second stage is organizing the information, and the third stage is ranking. This is generally known in the Internet World as Crawling, Indexing, and ranking.",
